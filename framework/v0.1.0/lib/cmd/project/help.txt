[ Add a new project ]

    You have 2 ways of creating your project

    1st method
    ----------
    $ gina project:add @<project_name> [ —-path=/var/www/<project_name> ] (if no path given, will take the current)

    where `/var/www/<project_name>` is the destination path
    NB.: `--path` can also be a relative path like `--path=./` or `--path=./<project_name>`
    If you do not specifiy a `<project_name>` for the `--path` argument , gina will reuse the one you used with `@<project_name>`
    
    This command line also supports relative path like `--path=./<project_name>`
