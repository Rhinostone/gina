Very convenient to several small but good restaurants. Very clean and well maintained. Housekeeping and other staff are all friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed sitting on the 2nd floor terrace over the entrance and \"people-watching\" on Esplanade Ave., also talking with our fellow guests. Some furniture could use a little updating or replacement, but nothing major.",

        "content": "We found the hotel de la Monnaie through Interval and we thought we'd give it a try while we attended a conference in New Orleans. This place was a perfect location and it definitely beat staying downtown at the Hilton with the rest of the attendees. We were right on the edge of the French Quarter withing walking distance of the whole area. The location on Esplanade is more of a residential area so you are near the fun but far enough away to enjoy some quiet downtime. We loved the trolly car right across the street and we took that down to the conference center for the conference days we attended. We also took it up Canal Street and nearly delivered to the WWII museum. From there we were able to catch a ride to the Garden District - a must see if you love old architecture - beautiful old homes(mansions). We at lunch ate Joey K's there and it was excellent. We ate so many places in the French Quarter I can't remember all the names. My husband loved all the NOL foods - gumbo, jambalya and more. I'm glad we found the Louisiana Pizza Kitchen right on the other side of the U.S. Mint (across the street from Monnaie). Small little spot but excellent pizza! The day we arrived was a huge jazz festival going on across the street. However, once in our rooms, you couldn't hear any outside noise. Just the train at night blowin it's whistle! We enjoyed being so close to the French Market and within walking distance of all the sites to see. And you can't pass up the Cafe du Monde down the street - a busy happenning place with the best French dougnuts!!!Delicious! We will defintely come back and would stay here again. We were not hounded to purchase anything. My husband only received one phone call regarding timeshare and the woman was very pleasant. The staff was laid back and friendly. My only complaint was the very firm bed. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Hotel de la Monnaie!",

The room I had was a little cramped, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. I was very relaxed and enjoyed the quiet, compared to staying exactly in the French Quarter. Everything you wanted to see was walking distance or you could have taken the trolley closer to town. Whenever I have the chance to return I will DEFINATELY consider staying here again. Thank you to everyone at the Avenue Garden Hotel for such a wonderful experience and great memories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

We recalled this gem from a stay last year. It is located in a former home, with whimsical detail to its dÃ©cor. Our rooms were nice size, clean & comfortable. Not large by 'chain' standards but certainly accommodating. Sorta feels like a nice B & B. No nightclubs nearby but Vieux Carreâ€™ is a 10 minute, $8 cab ride away. We were more interested in a little charm with lot less noise and no crowds in the street. Magazine St. with its shops is nearby. Plenty of nice restaurants, funky bars on this end of town plust ability for a morning run or â€˜chubby walkâ€™ down St. Charles. We appreciated the morning coffee, juices & light breakfast too. We recommend this if someone wants to try something other than the â€˜Quarter. Cool place, nice & gracious staff. Lotta bang for the buck.",

The private entrances, charming courtyard and extremely friendly staff can't be beat. The trolley car picks you up right in front of the hotel, and is wonderful for heading out into the Garden District to see the history and architecture, or to take you to the French Quarter for some serious partying.

Lydia, the manager (owner? not sure) is as sweet and helpful as she can be, and hotel staff are kind and always ready to help with anything. The location on St. Charles means a $6 cab ride to the French Quarter in one direction and Uptown in the other. This means you're not far from the party, but when you've had enough you're a cheap cab ride to your quiet hotel room. Also, the location means hailing a cab at most hours of the day/night is super easy. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable, the patio was precious. Stay here! You won't regret it. The price is so good I'd even call it underpriced. Highly, highly recommended!",

There are several local restaurants and bars that are very close and very affordable. The rooms are like an old boarding house and very romantic.

        "content": "I tagged along on my husband's work trip (not expensed) and had a great time. I think we made the perfect choice. PROS: 1. Location is fantastic. If you head out the back entrance you are a block from Bourbon street, yet when you return home you feel a world away, which is fantastic when you see how seedy some elements along Bourbon street are (FYI I felt safe the entire trip and walked around on my own). 2. Rooms, I thought they were great. Our bed was comfy, our room was well decorated. The bathroom, though not huge, was tasteful, and separate door for comode from the rest of the bathroom, which I liked. 3. Service, the conceirge was helpful, when I asked for guidance on two occasions I got knowledgeable, professional advice, without the condescending air some concierges have. Bellhop was friendly and helpful. I like turn down service, bring me little chocolates and bedside slippers and I'm a happy camper. Check in & check out were a breeze. 4. Crowd, pretty upscale people (I know, snobby, but New Orleans is a mixed bag my friends--part of the charm but nice to have a break from the \"charming\"). I saw a few NBA players from Houston in the lobby...funny how they stand out. 5. Cost, we found the rates for our dates more than affordable, given the caliber of the hotel 6. Gym, it's pretty darn nice for a hotel, they have the cardio room with individual TVs on the machines, a weight room, and a Yoga stretch room with weights, medicine balls and cool yoga mats. I spent like an hour doing yoga by myself, uninterrupted. fun. CONS: 1. Noise, our room faced Canal street and I didn't hear regular traffic but the first night I heard several sets of sirens from emergency vehicles. My husband never woke, and I didn't hear it subsequent nights. Perhaps a courtyard room would be quiter. 2. Pool, only indoor lap pool and jacuzzi. For such a hot climate, a nice pool scene could be fun. Tips 1. We traveled in January. I'm from San Diego and packed for San Diego winter. It was 75 degrees and 97% humidity. I made use of the Shops at Canal (Athropologie, Saks 5th Avenue, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor...I missed you JCREW coming FEb 2012). I wish I had brought one warm weather outfit \"Just in case\"...learn from my mistake. 2. Men bring sports coats, for restaurants like Galatoire's and Commander's Palace, where you'll stick out without one. (By the way, we enjoyed Galatoire's, Commander's Palace was disappointing to us). 3. St Charles Streetcar $1.25 one way, or $3 all day pass, need exact change, the pick up stop at Lady Footlocker on Canal about a block away. I had a Garden District walking tour in the travel book from the library and it gave history on homes in the area (ie Ann Rice's former home, Jefferson Davis' home, etc). Great city to visit.

I never did understand the breakfast charging although they tried to explain it to me twice, I'd paid for b & b but a small charge was made each morning for breakfast. I guess there must be a limit and we went over it.Anyway the food was plentiful,freshly cooked and very good.Try the New Orleans hash!! When I got home about two weeks later I had been charged for Room bar items to my credit card which we had not had. I never buy things from hotel room bars,too expensive.

Other visits to the hotel have made up for my one negative experience. Rooms are decent sized, clean with nice bedding, and the Davenport Lounge is a great place to grab a drink.

We were a group of 18 and the organizer got a great rate making our stay an amazing value...I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. We had lunch at Deannies kitty corner to the hotel and it was a great value... We also enjoyed the Ruby Slipper for breakfast (On Magazine St. just off Canal), a nice alternative to the IHOP down the street from the hotel.",

They are not dolled up for the tourist trade...unless, of course, the airport is also near the touristy areas of the city. That is certainly not the case with Boston's Logan airport. But the Logan Hilton was a fabulous surprise. From its lovely towering lobby to its spacious, well appointed rooms and it's pleasant staff, the only downside it that this is not a downtown hotel. Hotel excellence is all about attention to detail...and these guys get all the details right! One note... Careful before dining in the Publick House restaurant. While the food was decent, the prices were outrageous. It would be cheaper to take a taxi downtown and eat in a nice restaurant!",

        "content": "On Saturday, August 27th, I made an online reservation for an incoming student of mine from the DRC who was supposedly put on a Paris-Boston flight because all Paris-NYC flights that day had been canceled due to Irene. This student--whose English is poor-- had left me a text message about her flight change. I had no idea what time she was coming but I knew I had to get a room in Boston for her fast due to the weather. Well by 8 pm that night, I found out she was not coming to Boston. I panicked because I had used my personal credit card to make this reservation and I was four hours past the cutoff to cancel. I called reservations at the hotel and the man I spoke with couldn't have been nicer. He told me that there was no problem and that all fees due to my late cancellation would be waived because of Hurricane Irene. I apologized profusely but he insisted it was no problem. He then thanked me for being patient while he did all that was necessary to get me free of this charge. At the end, he even told me to stay safe in NYC. This man is absolutely lovely and if he is indicative of the quality of this hotel, then I say you won't go wrong here! Thank you, kind customer service rep!!!",

Lots of power points for charging stuff, including in bedside lamps: excellent. Big comfy bed, and great views over the airport and Boston. There was a wait in line to check in at 10:30 at night, but no wait at all second time around at about 5pm. We booked an Executive Room, but the lounge got so busy on the Sunday night that we took our snacks back to the room. Ate in Connolly's Publik (sic) House - fish & chips plus beef burger were both good, but the bar isn't very nice. The Fitness Room is well equipped, with free access via lobby. The staff are very friendly, especially the bellboys & reception. Only about a 10-15 minute walk to the airport, which is very convenient for an early flight.",

On arrival were were told that the travel agent booked us a king bed and not a double room as we requested when booking and made sure it was a double, as 2 blokes. the guy on reception was not moving on it, he said there will be a double room available on the tuesday, this was sunday when we came. he also advised us that it will be an extra 20 dollars per night in the double room. in fairness we were not impressed with his attitude and inflexibility. nothing we could do so we jst grinned and beared it. then to make things worse, our room was in the basement, beside the breakfeast room and the ice machines and vending machines. Pure pissed off afer paying 500euro each for this $@!#%. The room was serioulsy small, no room for our suitcases, a major squash round the king bed. pure noisy the following morning frm the machines outside our room, this should not be a room it should be a storage room, so not impressed. After one night in that room we asked the girl on reception if ther is any chance we could change room to a double, she checked and said yes, one is available and they are jst cleaning it and after that we can change room. Obviously the guy on reception the day b4 jst cudnt be bothered informing us of this. After we chaged rooms it was fine, room was ok for ny, not alot of space to move about, have stayed in better ones in ny. had no problem after we changed rooms, the girl on reception was very nice and helpful, she let me do check my online banking on her pc and let us use the phone when we neede to, at no cost, she couldnt be more nice. Love ny, done all the usual haunts and sites, grand location, great italian restaurant a few mins walk away, great food, and u get a discount when u mention u are staying in the gem hotel, the girl on reception gave us a card for the restaruant. What more can i say, the hotel was fine after the inital ignorance, our stay was more pleasant chatting away to the nice girl on reception, whos name i cant remember lol, long culry dark hair ha ha.",

        "content": "SUMMARY - Although the GEM Hotel is associated with the Choice Hotels chain (Quality, Comfort, Econo, etc.) this is the first time I've heard of this particular branding. They are billed as a \"Botique Hotel\" and certainly fit the bill as much as a chain can be considered a \"Botique\". The place is very bare bones and minimal, yet very stylish and modern. They just give you the very basics of what you need and not much else, but the price reflects that. So it's hard to complain. There are 10 floors and approximately 4 small rooms/floor. It's not the kind of place I'd spend a whole week because it's rather small, has limited storage, and very few of the \"extras\" you'd need for an extended stay. But for staying a night or two in NYC when you just need a place to sleep and shower it does just fine. I forgot to take photos this time, but as of today the photos the hotel has provided on various travel websites are fairly accurate. You just have to take a close look at them to see how small the space really is and understand that the photos really show the WHOLE room. There's not much cropped out! BATHROOM: Clean, basic, and modern. It was pretty much a standard hotel sized bathroom, even though the main room was small. BEDS: Two double beds. Very comfortable, leaning towards the soft side of hotel beds. Sheets were clean and more modern/stylish than you'd find in most chain hotels. BILLING: Reserved via choicehotels.com only a few days ahead of time. The front desk had no problems getting us checked in, and the taxes/surcharges only added up to another 16% of the cost of the room itself. BREAKFAST: There is free coffee/tea in the room, but i never looked for a continental breakfast. There were vending machines in the basement with the ice/water machine. CLEANING: The room was as clean as it gets. While the building is obviously old, it seems that the entire interior is brand new. CLIMATE CONTROL: There was a brand new heater/air conditioning unit that was very quiet and easily adjustable. ELEVATORS: One main, new looking elevator in the lobby. It worked just fine and was fairly large. FRONT DESK: The front desk was helpful and competent. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a room to be cleaned. They may have had the smallest, most basic lobby i've ever seen in my life. But if you're looking for water fountains and gold trim you're not going to get it in a hotel with sub-$200 rates! GYM: None. HOT TUB: None. INTERNET: Didn't try it. I was too busy enjoying the city. LOCATION: On the west-side on 36th very close to the corner of 10th. It's a much more sparsely populated and quiet area than most of Manhattan, as it borders on more of an industrial zone. However, it's only a few blocks to Times Square, Penn Station, and Madison Square Garden. It's a block from the entrace to the Lincoln Tunnel. It was nice to be so close to everything, yet just off the \"beaten path\" in a calmer area. There's a gas station on the corner (one of the few in Manhattan) and a few other random bodegas and restaurants nearby. NOISE: It's NYC, there's always going to be some noise, but there was nothing excessive. Lots of trucks roll down 10th avenue at night, but they mostly just blended into the background. PARKING: None. It's best to find a park & ride outside the city and take a train in. Penn Station is just 2 short blocks and then 2 long blocks away. POOL: None. RECREATION: None. RESTAURANT: None, but it's New York. I'm sure you can find something to eat. For the less adventurous, I did notice a McDonald's on 10th, just a short walk from the hotel. ROOM: The room was small and there wasn't much room around the beds. I'll admit, for 3 people, it was a bit cramped. If you like your space I'd limit occupancy to 2 or find another, bigger, hotel. There was limited storage, just one small wardrobe with 2 drawers underneath, a small nightstand, alarm clock/ipod player, desk, desk chair, and flat screen TV. Again, the decor was very modern. SHUTTLE: None. STORE: None on site, a gas station on the corner, several bodegas nearby. SUPPLIES: Standard Soap, Shampoo, Conditioner, Mouthwash & Towels. ===== ===== ===== RATING NOTE: My ratings are generally based on value vs money. Thus, sometimes a simple hotel will receive a 4 or 5, while a fancy hotel can rank a 1 or 2 if I don't feel it was worth the cost. Also, a hotel can do everything right and still only rank as a 4, unless there's something really exceptional about it. 5 = Hotel gets everything right, and goes above and beyond. 4 = Hotel gets everything right. 3 = Hotel is acceptable value for money spent. 2 = Hotel isn't worth the money spent. 1 = Hotel should pay ME to stay there.",

I get the impression that this hotel is meant more for business travelers - I don't remember seeing any other families. The pool is very nice - spacious and plenty of seating. There is a hot tub but it is indoors in the spa / workout area. We stayed on the 5th floor and had very nice views. The only thing keeping me from giving this hotel 5 stars is that housekeeping left a bit to be desired. It was noticeable that they hadn't cleaned behind the bathroom door in some time - lots of fingerprints etc. Maybe that's just my own pickiness. Also on the last 24 hours of stay we were literally rationing toilet paper (not replenished by housekeeping) and did without wash cloths - they left us 1 for a room that accomodates 4 guests. I know that we could have asked for more - but in this type of hotel I expect those things to be handled without my having to ask.",

Top marks also go to the huge rooms with queen beds, amazing staff and larger fitness center with well appointed and maintained equipment. I stayed at this hotel for a wedding and received a room rate that is practically unheard of. And the reception was AMAZING! Nice work. My only issue was the requirement of a rental car but I think thatâ€™s a Dallas thing â€“ itâ€™s a land of highways and strip malls so donâ€™t expect public transportation or the ability to walk places :(",

        "content": "FIrst of all Id like to start off with something I noticed other reviews: I dont understand how people can give a hotel bad ratings overall just because they dont like the location. Sure you cant walk to places to eat or shop from the hotel but you knew this when you mad a reservation here, its not the hotels fault you cant use a map! Ok, with that being said I booked this hotel for a last minute stay int he area, I normally like to stay more towards the center of Dallas but with a rate of $92 all in I figured I couldnt go wrong. An additional incentive to me was their comp. self parking in a garage, I dont mind paying to park but I dont trust most valets with some of my diff. cars. When I arrived at the hotel I noticed while about 15 minutes to downtown it was right off the expressway so it was no problem to get anywhere in the city in a decent amount of time. The bell staff were quick to collect my bags and take me to my room. The rooms werent very large but were decorated very nicely as the rest of the hotel was and were more then adequate for 1 or 2 people. I did not notice any elevator noise as some complained of. The only downside I noticed on the hard product the outside of the hotel could use a good pressure cleaning or fresh paint. Service was where the Omni really impressed me. Ive stayed at lots of 5-Diamond hotels that would have trouble keeping up with the Omni's service standard. I was always greeted very quickly and by name. Everything was done quickly when I requested it and I never once heard a no. I had one unusual request that they had no need to fulfill but they did it for me anyways, I was very impressed! I normally do not eat at the hotels as I like to go to local, well known establishments when Im in different cities. However, one night I was extremely tired and not very hungry. I ordered a childrens cheese burger with french fries (probably the same size as the adult burger!), ice cream for dessert and a bottle of Pellegrino water, for around $12. The quality was very good as well. I would not hesitate to stay here again, very good job to everyone at the Omni!",

The staff even gave suggestions on the activites to do around the area. They never appeared too busy to help or annoyed by any question. The room was very comfortable and had a nice view. What a bed! You just sink into it. Overall this is the best hotel I have booked, and I enjoy staying at high rated hotels. Also, the price was pretty good.

When checking in, the receptionist warned me my room was close to elevators and gave me an opportunity to swap rooms if I needed to. A nice, customer-friendly touch. I used room service on one of the nights I was there. It was Ok, nothing special, but the prices seemed typical for a hotel of this quality. I didn't try any of the hotel restaurants.

        "content": "this is my second time to stay in ibis hotel bencoolen. the first time i was with my husband and young daughter, and i hardly noticed the lack of space. but this time my second daughter tagged along, so with the four of us in one room, it was a bit of a squeeze. well, i guess you get what you pay for. the downside of the hotel was definitely the small room and absence of closets (there were a lot of shelves though), as well as hardly any space in the bathroom to put your toiletries and stuff (not even a ledge in the shower to put your shampoo). if you're a shopaholic planning to buy bags and bags of stuff from singapore, you might not have any room left to walk on in the room. but, i must admit that the good points of the hotel do outnumber the bad ones. for one, the room was *VERY* CLEAN. a big thumbs up in my book! the last time i stayed there was two years ago, and the level of cleanliness didn't change at all. even the floors still looked brand new! the room had pretty much all of the basic comforts of a hotel... a nice flat tv, comfy bed, kettle, coffee and tea, towels... water pressure was excellent. plus, their free wi-fi was working perfectly, and the room also had an international electric outlet for appliances. loved it! this hotel is good if you're travelling with friends, or solo on a business trip. it's good for small families too, but a word of caution: very young kids could get tired just from walking from the hotel to the nearest mtr station (bugis) which is around 15 minutes away. you have to cross EXTREMELY crowded street markets to get to bugis junction (HOLD ON to your kids, the markets can get really packed!!). plus, you have to contend with the unmerciful heat and humidity while walking on the street, and boy, hot, sweaty, tired kids can really take on stress-inducing levels of whining and complaining! after that, we decided, what the heck, let's forget the mtr and just take the taxi! it helped that taxis regularly came and went outside the hotel, so that saved a LOT of our sanity. if i were travelling without kids, though, i wouldn't mind the walking distance that much. it can get pretty tiring having to lug all your shopping bags from bugis to the hotel (as i said, it's a good 15 minute walk in the heat... well maybe 10 minutes if you're fast), but the good side is that there are loads of neat sites nearby, like the national library, religious temples, and hawker centers. if you're a bit of an adventurer or wanderer, then you will have a lot to explore. and oh, the 7-11 and guardian convenience store right outside the hotel were big plusses, too!",

The room was a wee bit small - but adequate. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the pool. If you do stay here avoid room 219 as it is next to a gents toilet (not a problem in itself) but the flush is noisy and, of course, the toilet can be used at any time of the day or night. The room has free tea/coffee and the usual minibar and an internet connection (charged for). It lacks a welcome pack outlining the hotel's services and amenities - you have to ask the concierge or at reception if you want information. The views from the rooms at the front of the hotel are great - but the views from the side of the hotel are very different. It's well worth the while making sure that you do have a good view. The breakfasts are great (you may have to queue to get your eggs cooked) and there is a good choice to suit most tastes. The basics are the same each day - but there is always something different each day (I've never had curried chickpeas for breakfast before - but they were well worth trying)!!! The location of the hotel is great - just a few minutes walk from a large choice of restaurants and bars (exit the hotel and turn left then walk along the river with the river on your right). Many sights, attractions and shopping malls are within walking distance (although taxis are a cheap alternative). We had a great five days here and we will be returning.",

        "content": "My husband and I booked the pre-cruise package for a one-night stay in September 2011. The hotel itself is very nice - front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms and common areas were quite clean and comfortable. Even the business center was nice, with 3 computers and printing services. Several options for lunch/dinner within walking distance, and I felt safe walking around. We called from the airport to request shuttle pickup, and the shuttle arrived within 15 minutes. The included breakfast was your average hotel breakfast - though I've had better options at other Fairfield Inns around the country. The reason I'm giving this hotel a 2-star rating is because of the noise level in the room. Sure, you can hear the planes taking off - this is to be expected. The problem was that there was some kind of club/restaurant nearby that played extremely loud music until at least 2am. We were on the top floor of the hotel - where presumably the street noise would be at its quietest - and it sounded like the band was right in our room. We had to blast the A/C and keep the tv on all night at a medium volume to drown out the bass. This was on a Friday night. I know the hotel can't control what other nearby properties do, but this was ridiculous. Fair warning to those looking to book on a weekend night! The other problem we had was with the shuttle service to the port on the morning of our cruise. We had a shuttle reservation for 12pm, so we took our time getting ready that morning. The shuttle driver called our room at 10:40, begging us to switch to the 11am shuttle! He said that the original 12pm shuttle we were booked on was definitely going to be running late, and that we needed to be on the 11am shuttle to be safe. We felt very rushed and were confused about why this was happening. I'm thinking this was probably a random, one-time thing - but I wanted to report my experience. This hotel was nice, but I won't be staying here again - I book hotels because I want to sleep at them, not listen to club music all night. Poor location.",

We had issues at the airport and ended up in Miami even earlier than expected. The excellent staff (Mitch Betmudez & Liz) were so understanding, professional and helpful that they held onto our luggage for us (6 bags) pointed us to a local resturant for breakfast (which they were right it was a wonderful breakfast). When we returned they set us up in our rooms as early as they could, since we were all up for more than 24 hrs. Once we were all rested we had a wonderful dinner and enjoyed the hotels happy hour. The hotel is gorgeous, the art work and lobby are very modern. Our rooms were very clean and the bed was very comfortable. In the morning we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast which had a wide variety of breakfast items. We enjoyed our stay so much that we do plan on returning to see more of Miami and plan on staying there again. I truely hope this helps you in making your decision when deciding on a GREAT hotel while in Miami. I also read reviews prior to selecting the Fairfield Inn for our stay. It lived up to all that I read and so much more. A special thanks to Mitch and Liz for all that you did for us even though to you it might be a normal day. Well be back D. Jensen from California",

Four of us stayed in adjoining rooms and it was perfect with only about a 10-15 minute drive to the Hospital. The Interstate is right there and only a 15 minute drive to downtown, except during rush hour. The staff was friendly and helpful (save for one of the women who took care of the breakfast area - no smile or personality and needed to be a bit more attentive to cleaning tables and spills). On the other hand, they have one of the better continental breakfasts that we have experienced at a hotel. You can tell they are trying to do a good job. The building may be a little old but it is obvious they have made renovations, painted and decorated nicely, especially the lobby, which was also comfortable. The rooms were clean and bright and despite being on a busy and noisy thoroughfare, it was quiet. We had a good nights sleep every night. There is a nice Indian Restaurant next to the hotel that we liked and they provide room service. There is a Starbucks (of course they are everywhere) and convenience store across the street. A mall, with many different restaurants, is within walking distance. This is not a luxurious hotel and some people my not care for the exterior, balcony access to the rooms. That did not bother us at all and we found Nexus to be the perfect place to stay. It is in a good location and the price is right.",

The staff is young and 1 was more interested in texting than helping me. I will say however, that the location is good and the hotel was quiet. Room service was polite and fast. Shopping and a couple good restaurants are close by. Service can fluctuate everywhere you go, but I couldn't get past the patch jobs. Hate to be a snob, but I'm looking for spotless.",

        "content": "I booked this hotel via Priceline and got a room on the front side of the hotel with a \"view\" of the city and I-5. Better than looking at the backside of stores on the backside of the hotel. The front side once you get in your room is very quiet. The rooms are very large and we had plenty of space to put out 4 suitcases and carry on's and spread out a bit even. Bathroom is a bit small, however there is a 15 minute timer heat lamp for when you get out of the shower or bath which is very nice. Water pressure is great and temperature can be as hot or cold as you want it. The vanity area is nice, but the sink pressure is a bit weak and the water is split out into a lot of small jets instead of one stream. Big plus in the room is the small refrigerator and microwave along with a coffee maker. We did not use the last 2 items but the refrigerator was great! Airco/heater units are a bit dated, but quiet and cool or heat your room pretty fast. Check in was simple and fast even when arriving at 8pm at night. The first room we got had a problem with the bottom of the door,which the maintenance guy on duty said he could not fix on his shift and went back to the front desk and got us another room within 5-10 minutes. We had 2 other minor issues which were responded to quickly during the day. Houskeeping starts at 8am, but does not check occupied rooms until after 9am. Very friendly staff and they keep the rooms spotless during your stay. Check out was fast, but the bell carts were nowhere to be found and a housekeeping person had to go look for one which took 10-15 minutes. That was the only down side. Wireless internet is fast in the room with excellent signal strength as there is a repeater on every floor. There are 2 older desktop pc's in the lobby that are free to use, however being public pc's there is no privacy programs to erase your history or filed in field entries. The CPU fans get very noisy when there are a lot of graphics being displayed. However web browsing is very fast! No charge to use them or to print documents out. A very nice thing to have. Lobby was spotless and modern and lots of daylight. Continental breakfast is good, you can make you own \"Belgian\" waffles, fresh fruit, eggs of various styles each day and bacon or sausage to go with them. Menu varies each day with waffles being the main item. Coffee and juice are also available. Wireless internet if you need it, with plug in's around the walls. Big screen TV's tuned to CNN. Breakfast is from 6-10am each day. We did not use the restaurant. Location is great, just off of I-5 at Northgate. Short distance to the mall from the hotel. A bit of a walk or a short drive with the car. Overall a pleasant place to stay.",

The view of the Hollywood sign, the Capitol Records building and the Pantages theater just can't be beat. The room is very well layed out with a separate lounge area that includes a very cool circular couch and a wet bar. The bed was extremely comfortable and we both enjoyed a very relaxing night of sleep. One note, the hotel is right on Hollywood Blvd, and the noise from the street can be a bit loud. Just bring some ear plugs and realize you're in the middle of a vibrant city and you'll be just fine. As always, the valet parking was extremely convenient as we needed to get our car out several times and everytime it was waiting for us a few minutes after we called from the room. The service is always great. Joey, our bellman, gave us a full rundown of how to work everything in the suite and also gave us a description of the different types of rooms available at the hotel. He was extremely helpful. All of the staff was very helpful and accomodating. Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived at noon, but we gave them our mobile phone number and they called as soon as it was available at 2pm. To sum it up, great hotel, great location, and great staff! We'll be coming back again soon!",

We were booked at a cheaper hotel elsewhere, but by the time we assessed the cost of parking plus the hassle factor of LA traffic, the slightly more expensive nightly rate ended up being worth it. The room itself was nice. The view though, not so much. Just based on where we were, our view was of the wall of the rooms across the way. When we looked to the right, we were overlooking the main entrance and to the left was the back of the hotel. So, we were in a room that had a view of the \"alley\" between the buildings for the property. Not a big deal - jsut be aware you might not have much to look at. The bed itself was very comfortable. It was different though; very low to the ground. It looked somewhat like a futon but definately made up for it in comfort. The bathroom was nicely appointed and had all the amenities you would expect. The room was primarily a \"heavy white plastic\". While it looks very classy and eclectic now, it will start showing the wear and tear soon unless the hotel keeps up on it's maintenance.",

I did revisit the property under my fiancee's name and SPG acct so that we wouldnt get any special consideration due to speaking with Jim....happy to say that we had a great time...were given a great upgraded room (my Fiancee is also a platinum SPG so upgrade was available)...staff was very friendly and room service was quik \"and' good....now remember this is a Niteclub venue as well...and you should know that when booking your resv...the hotel tries its best to accomodate its guests in regards to the venue and the pool but as in LV, the venue also has a greater degree of control on access etc so make nice to the venue mgrs via the hotel staff or the WW staff... Pool is a bit small but has a goood vibe and yes lots n lots of beautiful people....even some that were never invited to the party,,lol yes the curb and valet staff do need some work and some lessons on manners but remember most of them its their first job and with a property like the W they probably wont last long or wil be trained appropriately as time goes on...remember staff reflects mgmt and the Mgmt there definately wants to put its best foot forward so suffice to say that nothing is perfect but sometiems a willingness to be perfect is just as good... i will definately recommend W Hollywood to my friends....my only regret is that i didnt get to meet Jim McPartlin (GM) sooner as he is a great guy who has had to practically re learn his job to deal with all of the new age way of running a Niteclub Venue Hotel and i must say he has done a wonderful job...The good thing is that he will be going to the W NYC soon so since we are there often i am sure that we will still be able to enjoy another venue run by a Top Notch W Veteran such as Jim....

There is no Casino and it is right at the end of the strip, they do however run a complimentary shuttle to the Wynn and Cesars Palace and it is not like there is not enough choice when it comes to Casinos in Vegas! Our room was fantastic, huge with a mini kitchen, sofa and table and fabulous bathroom with whirl pool tub and walk in shower, twin sinks and even a tv built into the mirror. Valet parking was complimentary and although they charge a $19 a night 'resort fee' which gives access to wi-fi we were aware of that when we booked so it was not a surprise to us. We didnt have a great view as we overlooked a half finished hotel but we could watch the strip light up at night. We got a fantastic rate for this hotel which made it great value for money, if you were paying the full advertised rate you would expect everything we experienced and probably more.",

We had booked our rooms (3) directly with the hotel and one week prior to arrival we called and canceled ONE NIGHT of our reservation. Upon arrival the hotel had no record. After about an hour they finally found the reservation (they claimed they were changing booking systems) and finally cleared us for our rooms. We checked our bags curbside (we had all driven in) and went to our rooms. After waiting an hour we started to call the front desk to find out where out bags were. No one knew. We called several times and could not get a decent explaination. Our bags finally arrived after almost 2 hours and with no appology or explaination. The afternoon of our second day our 21 year old son called to say his key wasn't working and when he went to the front desk they explained that the reservation was only for one night. We then discovered that all 3 rooms were \"turned over\" as the wonderful front desk staff had only corrected THEIR reservation mistake for one day. After a visit to the manager the hotel did solve the problem but I would never stay at another Trump property. It is not worth the frustration! If this is the common Trump experience I would watch for a bankrupcy notification.",

Beds are poor, she shift down on the head's side of the bad. the beds are shorter than the frame. the rooms are large and nice. it's also not at the strip (what you can see an the map as well but just to mention). staff is quite rude and unfriendly (specially the check in clerk. strip view you can forget. they charge extra money but you see nothing. it's fully behind the treasury island. The first room we got smelled strongly like smoke. hotel has a bad reputation in Las Vegas. Is known as arrogant and rude staff!! funny, this was also our impression we got of the hotel. finally, you only can do valet parking and always have to wait. if you're waiting for a taxi being organized, it could happen that they just to skip you because there's a other customer behind you they like more. if you finally try to catch your own taxi (after seeing two leaving empty), these odd hotel guys start to tell you off. how cheeky! I tell you... we took our own cab and I told this guy to show more respect. we have several gold cards too but we probably do not wave them around all the time...! this hotel should think about this. Only go there if you get a special rate. it’s far away from the strip and really offers a nice room only. venetian is much better.",

Our \"closet\" wasn't even tall enough to hang up a shirt without the bottom brushing the shelf! (We had the railings outside on our balcony, of course, but since it rained both our nights there, that was counter-productive) -The shower and I didn't get along. Futzy temperature control burned me, then froze me. Water pressure left something to be desired. Overall, the good definitely outweighs the bad, and I would stay there again for sure!",

Tacking on an additional 6 nights, our stay at \"The Parrot\" was 9 days/8nights of nothing but complete relaxation and enjoyment. Chock full of character, this place is designed as a maze of walkways through gardens and grottos, with hidden nooks around every corner. Once you're here, it truly feels like a different world. If you want to lay in a shaded hammock and quietly enjoy a book, you got it. If you want to lay by the pool and soak up the rays, you got it. If you want to stroll over to the poolside bar and order up a cocktail or quick bite, you got it. Fine dining on premises, you got it. Spotlessly clean, spacious, well-appointed rooms worthy of 4 stars, you got it. But here's the best thing you've got......personalized service from a family and their staff who are second to none. Usually after a stay of this length, you can find something, even something minor, to complain about-something that you would do differently if it were your place. The only thing we would do differently is to stay longer next time! The Lazy Parrot is a one-in-a million gem and we will return, hopefully soon!",

        "content": "I just returned from Puerto Rico where we spend part of our trip in Rincon at The Lazy Parrot Inn. It is nestled in the hills and has views of the ocean. We stayed in the new building - our room was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated with a large balcony overlooking the swimming pool. There is a casual, friendly feel to the place and it was a nice contrast to the large resort in San Juan where we had stayed. The pool is nice but the hot tub was cold during our visit. There are 2 restaurants, one outdoors by the pool which has a decent menu and good food. We did not eat at the restaurant upstairs which is a little more formal but the menu looked inviting. There are some lovely outdoor tables set in little secluded areas. There are 2 cages with parrots and love birds that our kids loved. Our stay included continental breakfast which again was eaten by the pool. While waiting for our dinner the first night, our kids played with other kids around the pool area while we chatted with other guests. It was definately relaxing for us and our children. On the downside, when we arrived, we had already been in Peurto Rico for a week and had three big pieces of luggage. We had to lift them up a flight of stairs, then down a series of steps at the other side and then up two flights of stairs to our room!!! I asked if there was anyone to help with bags and was told no! On our departure, we discovered that we could drive down the side of the inn and bring our bags out by the bar but that still involved lugging them down two flights. Also, on our first night, the ice machine was out of ice and the blender to make frozen drinks was broken. The second night we stayed, there was an engagement party by the pool and some other event going on and the place was crowded. We placed our order for dinner shortly before 8pm and at 8:40pm were told that they were out of one of the items that we ordered. I ordered a salad instead (thinking it would be quick) but by 9pm still no food and one of our kids had fallen asleep. At that point, we cancelled our order and went to our room. There was music blaring by the pool until 11pm which was right underneath our balcony. This may have been a once off - the waiter was really haried - but it might be worth checking with them if there are any parties scheduled during your stay. Also, there is a small step-up going from the pool area to the breakfast area that is not that obvious and we noticed a few people trip over it. On the morning we were leaving, a woman fell over it dropping a glass plate and landed on a piece of broken glass that went into her knee. This is a definate hazard that could be easily rectified by painting the step up a bright color. Pool hours are only from 10am to 6pm but did not seem to be strictly enforced. Our kids are early risers and bugged us from 8am to go in the pool but we did not permit them because of the rule. We were more comfortable with breaking it when other guests were swimming in the pool outside these hours. You also need your own towels to bring to the beach, which we did not know. On the whole, we loved the ambiance and the casual laid back feel at the Lazy Parrot. I think we were unfortunate on our second night and that this may have been an anomoly. We would give it another try.",

The grounds are perfectly manicured, the whole thing is right on the seafront; all the rooms and facilities, including the pools are sea facing. The hot tub by the main pool is HOT - very painful if you've spent too much time in the sun! Our room was slightly worn around the edges, but beautifully furnished and decorated. The one negative was that the air conditioning was way too loud to have on at night. We had to switch it off and rely upon the fan. The night we stayed, the restaurant was not open, but we had a perfectly acceptable meal at the cafe. The menu was not extensive and was the same for both lunch and dinner, zo more variety would-be appreciated for an extended stay. The beach was particularly beautiful, with soft white sand and plenty of shade for those who need it. We would definitely return here and wish we had been able to stay longer.",

        "content": "All I can say about the Caribe Hilton is that it was just OK. The facility and grounds were fine and enjoyable but the room was totally NOT what I expected from a Hilton Resort. Our room was in the main tower on the 5th floor and I hated it from the moment we walked in. It is old and dated and in desperate need of a facelift. I have stayed here in the past (which is why I decided to stay here again) but it was nothing like I remember. It was very disappointing and I highly doubt if I would ever stay here again. For what we were paying I expected better accommodations. I have stayed at other Hilton Hotels and at least you felt like you were getting your money's worth even if it was not an executive suite ! This room does not hold a candle to those. I attempted a room change but was told by the staff member who checked us in that unfortunately there was nothing else available and would not be for a few days. Let's see where do I begin. On top of the fact that the room had seen better days, the TV did not work properly with or without the remote. The dresser had a door in front of it that was loose and coming off the hinges. We complained about both and they sent two people up to fix the door but the TV problem was NEVER resolved. At first they blamed it on the cable company, then on the remote, then on the TV itself. (however our friends across the hall had no problem with their TV from the start). Let's see what else...the air conditioning was difficult to control. One minute we were hot and the next we were freezing. We had a problem with the tub because the water would not drain properly. The bathroom also had loose fixtures. I spent the first four days trying to correct the various problems with the front desk staff and several managers. One manager explained that this is an old hotel and they are in the process of renovating...but it's a very slow process. The maintenance staff must be pretty busy round the clock ! We did however like the facilities, spa, and grounds. We were traveling with a 14 year old who enjoyed the pool. Most of the staff were polite and pleasant. All I can say is please heed the warnings on this website and do not be fooled by pretty pictures on the internet. For what they are charging, unless you are planning on staying in one of the executive suites (which I understand are much nicer)....go somewhere else !",

        "content": "First let me start by saying that my girlfriends and I were kind of weary about going to Puerto Rico (which I must say turned out to be the most beautiful place and fun), much less about the hotel. But since I waited a little too late for my passport, we chose to go ahead and go. After much carousing and reviewing of all the different hotels in San Juan, we settle on the Caribe Hilton. We really didn't know what to expect because some of the reviews were very exceptional and some were down right anti-Caribe. We arrived in San Juan on Friday May 23rd and stayed until Tuesday May 27th. Upon arriving and checking in at the Caribe Hilton I notified the check in desk that I was a Hilton Honors member and immediately got a free upgrade. I'm not sure were we where staying prior but we were upgraded to the Garden Towers on the 4th floor. The room had 2 bathrooms (only one had a shower), a king size bed and a pullout sofa bed in the living room. There was a television in each room. It came with a safe and refrigerator. It was nicely decorated and gave you the feel of apartment living. We had 2 separate balconies with an entrance to each one. The view was partial garden and partial ocean, which was very nice. After we settled down into the room, two of us decided to go downstairs to one of the hotel restaurants to eat. We chose Palmeras...which was a great thing....because every Friday they have an all you can eat Seafood buffett (great for those seafood lovers). They had sauteed lobster ready to eat, stone crab claws sauteed ready to eat, fried shrimp, baked fish, cold boiled shrimp, various choices of salads with seafood...it was AMAZING. Yes, it was a little pricey...about $52 per person, but it was worth every bit of the price. While we were eating we did have a small incident take place back at our room. The other young lady left behind in the room had a nice surprise when she stepped out of the shower. There was another set of guest sitting in the living room. After trying to straighten it out herself (hard due to language constraints), I paid a visit to the front desk and spoke with the manager. She kindly apologized, changed the keys and gave us a $75.00 credit towards our room. This really did come in handy because it just about covered our tab at the restaurant. Each day was a new adventure at the hotel. There was the lively breakfast buffet that Palmera had every morning, not to mention a great menu selection too. Did I mention how awesome the wait staff is in this restaurant, especially Efrim, he's very attentive and as a guest you will not lack quality service. Then there's the mimosa's served that you could take by the pool area and layout. The pool area was absolutely beautiful and spacious. Several pools to choose from. There was small private beach, however, alongside of the Caribe's property was a public beach and there were a lot of visitors. The Caribe offered the rental of paddle boats at the hotel to take out on the water. There were water activities going on in the private area of the beach. It was great. There was never a shortage of cabs in the front of the hotel. Or you could walk 2 blocks and catch the city bus to Old San Juan to get there in 10 minutes for only .75 cents and it lets you off right by the cruise docks. The great part about this hotel is the location. It's not in the middle of all the Old San Juan hustle and bustle and it's not part of the Isla Verde fast paced strip. You can have quiet and then you can take a cab or bus to the busy areas in under 10 minutes. Any time of night or day. A great perk about this hotel is not just the boutiques that are located there in the hotel or the modern openness of the lobby, but it's the great convenience of the Starbucks. Located in the downstairs lobby. Great for the late night recoveries. Go downstairs get a cup of mojo and go back to the room to wake up. Lastly I can not go without mentioning how great the room service and housekeeping was. We were never short of towels and if we happened to use to many (because women do that sometimes) we called housekeeping for more and in a matter of 15 minutes we would have our fresh towels. We put in a late night call to room service for a request of a microwave, within a matter of 20minutes we had a microwave set up in our room, free of charge. The staff was great, service was great, ambiance was one of a kind. I will definitely be staying at the Caribe Hilton the next time I visited Puerto Rico, hands down!",

        "content": "I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from May 5th - May 8th. I liked a lot of things about the hotel (the open-air lobby, the Starbucks, the cleanliness of the rooms and the tropical garden) but there were a few issues: 1) There was no one at the check-in desk when I arrived. If you were Hilton Honors or a VIP your line was staffed but there was no one there for normal check-ins. Not the best first impression. 2) Room service trays and garbage were not picked up promptly from the hallways. When my next door neighbor had dinner his tray of half-eaten food remained outside the room until lunchtime the next day. This happened more than once. 3) Beach service was spotty. One day there was someone taking orders but the next day there was no one to be seen. I don't mind getting up to get my drinks and food but sometimes you just want to veg out and not move. 4) Food and drink prices are extraordinarily high. $10 for a Bud Light! That's ridiculous. 5) There needs to be a higher level of attentiveness to guests from some of the staff. One evening when I tried to get a cab to take me to the casino at the El San Juan Hotel, it took 5 minutes of standing around before the staff stopped chatting with each other to ask if they could help. All in all, I had a great trip because the weather in PR was wonderful and the beach at the hotel was really all I needed for a relaxing stay. Would I stay here again? Maybe if I found a really great rate but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

The food choices were outrageously expensive for a family of 4 to eat at. The only restaurant within walking distance was a Subway. The pool area was nice for kids and there was a nice beach that appeared to be man-made. Overall we had a good experience here but I just felt it was overpriced.",

        "content": "The Hilton Caribe is a nice place overall.( *I'm use to staying at really nice hotels like the J.W Marriott and Ritz, so that's my point of view). I stayed in the Villas with 3 of my friends ( 3rd floor w/ ocean view). The bedroom is an okay size- 2 queen beds, nice bathroom and nice balcony view of the condado. The kitchenette is cute, it includes a small fridge, sink, microwave, cabinets, and counter space. Bedroom Cons: not much floor space for luggage, no WIFI (which was a HUUUUGE disappointment). I couldn't believe that in 2008 Hilton didn't have WIFI in the bedrooms. But we were able to pick up the WIFI from the Condado Plaza Hotel (Mariott- i think) across the water. So make sure you know how to use your phone as a modem or bring some type of wireless card if you go. (they only have free WIFI in the lobby). Room service is really expensive Bedroom Pros: Nice clean linen, nice size bathroom, nice balcony, good service. You can also buy food and store it in the cabinets and fridge. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Hilton was not as glamorous as I thought it would be, but it is nice. The lobby was clean and it's kind of cool how it's connected to the outside- meaning that when you arrive to the hotel you get out of your car and automatically step into the lobby. The pool and beach area is great, simply nice. Its not grandeur, but its very extensive- the property includes alot: gardens, pools, jacuzzis, beaches, playground area, bars, decks, ponds, exotic fish and animals and more- I was not able to fully explore this area, but my friends were able to and they LOVED it. It's a great place for couples at night. The villas has its own separate lobby which is really small, but its somewhat convenient when you need help and information. But I did NOT like all the construction being built - because of the construction going on outside the lobby of the Villas, the outside of the villa area was ugly (very gray and gloomy). Overall Hilton Pros: perfect location- the Hilton seems to be in the middle of everything (Old San Juan (5 minutes away), the Condado (5 minutes away), Isla Verde(12 minutes away), Airport (15 minutes away) plus its a low traffic area so we barely got caught in traffic (which is everywhere in PR), the Hilton pool and beach area offers the widest variety of things to do, and nice people. Overall Hilton Cons: all the Construction, no WIFI, not very glamorous, lack of floor space in rooms w/ 2 beds Most people say the Hilton is overpriced, but I personally think you are paying for the location over anything else b/c the hotel itself is not very ritzy- it's sort of aesthetically disappointing, but you have to keep in mind that this is Hilton's first hotel in the Caribbean (they actually consider it historic) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I also visited The Ritz, El San Juan Hotel, and the Intercontinental. The Ritz's beach was very disappointing and dirty.The intercontinental lobby, beach, and pool area was really pretty (i visited at night), but they all seemed kind of small (and their Casino is really small, but busy). El San Juan Hotel is the hot spot- the lobby is BEAUTIFUL and very grand i felt like i was in a fashion magazine- EVERY person there was BEAUTIFUL. It is veeeerry busy, so if you want to watch alot of beautiful people-go there. If you ever visit that hotel (especially at night) be sure to have your best and most fashionable clothes on w/ makeup & hair done etc. (women should wear dresses that compliment their body types with heels and men should just look clean and smell good). If you want to live the \"high life\" you should stay at a hotel like El San Juan, but if you want to relax you should stay at a hotel like the Hilton. El San Juan Hotel is sort of a place for single people (their are too many temptations there especially for men) and other hotels are better for couples and families. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL Puerto Rico Advice: First off, I lost my camera in a taxi on the first night which made me really sad (b/c i lost over 200 pics) and put a little damper on my trip. So I greatly advise everyone to find one taxi driver and stick with them throughout your stay (be sure to ALWAYS get their name, number, and taxi number or license plate). But moreover to Truly experience Puerto Rico you should rent a car. After my experience I advise you to use taxi's for a day, then drive after that- you can get more done and you feel more free! Places to visit: 1. Old San Juan is a must at night (eat at a great restaurant and walk around and visit a club or three) 2. The rain forest (this was probably the best day we had in Puerto Rico- it was BEAUTIFUL!)- bring water and/or drinks, oh and good shoes 3. Culebra, Vieques, or Gilligans Island - you MUST visit one of the three (but visiting one of those will be an all day trip because you will need to arrive early and take ferries to them (so be sure to bring snacks, drinks, snorkel equipment, and an umbrella). 4. Forts in Old San Juan (Fort San Cristobal is better than el Morro) 5. For young people: -Isla Verde at night is a must, definitely go to the clubs, bars, and El San Juan Hotel -Senor Frogs (old san juan), Brava (el san juan hotel), and just ask around. . . (Vibes seemed nice, but we didnt get to go) 6. The Condado at night is really pretty too, when we went there were singers and performers on the big lawn/park area. 7. Ponce is a nice area with many historic places, gardens, etc. . .(old french town so it looks different from old San Juan). You should plan before you get there b/c its very easy to go astray and not get as much done as you want. Remember that EVERYTHING closes early (around 6pm) so tourist activities MUST be planned early and they must be done during the day. At night Old San Juan, the Condado, and Isla Verde are the best. . .If you drive be very cautious b/c people drive very loose down there. Though Puerto Rico is an American territory - 75% of the people their speak Spanish ONLY -if not more. So you should have a basic knowledge of spanish and download some type of translation program on your phone (i just used babelfish.altavista.com- which is an online translator). Walgreens are everywhere (and that will be your grocery and everything else store during the trip (we went almost everyday:-). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall I LOVED Puerto Rico and I was not ready to go back after 5 days, I felt like I needed atleast 1 or 2 more days. I loved how racism and colorism just seemed to go out the window and everyone loved/liked each other for who they were and respected everyone's individual beauty. So don't be a typical stiff American when you go- relax, have fun, talk to random people no matter their background, race, or ethnicity. Most phone companies don't charge for using your phone in Puerto Rico, but call and make sure. Okay, I think my review is long enough. . . Vive (las) Puerto Rico! lol. . . . Adios! *make sure your camera has a strap on it and put your name and number on it- I would hate for anyone else to lose their camera. * you'll easily notice that most Puerto Ricans seem to be in relationships b/c everywhere you go there will be couples *as an attractive dark-skin woman of color i felt sooo Beautiful in Puerto Rico, everywhere i went i was told how gorgeous i was, not only by Puerto Rican men (and even some women) but by many white Americans (people seem to lose their prejudices in Puerto Rico)- this made my trip even better- i felt like a Goddess there:-)",

        "content": "We stayed at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan for a week in October of 2004 and had a wonderful time. I read the many \"mixed\" reviews about this hotel and others before making our reservation. There were positive and negative reviews for almost all the hotels we considered. Based on the negative reviews of some of the older rooms at the Hilton, I called the hotel directly and reserved a renovated room in the Tower. We were thrilled with the room....ocean and lagoon view, fabulous walk-in glass enclosed shower, king size bed). Our package included the daily breakfast buffet (fantastic), plus free access to their nice fitness center. We rented a car and thought the location was great (it's the closest resort style hotel to Old San Juan) and also has easy access to Condado. The Hilton has beautiful grounds, a wonderful resort type pool and private beach....but don't go to San Juan expecting fabulous Caribbean beaches...you would need to go to resorts in other parts of Puerto Rico for those beaches. The meals at the hotel were good but pricey. We had dinner twice at Aqua Viva, a seafood restaurant in Old San Juan, and loved it! We also found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful. The original part of the Caribe Hilton was built around 1950 and has a nice history...one of the first major resorts in the Caribbean....and hosted stars like Frank Sinatra....they also invented the Pina Colada here. Although extensively renovated over the years...from some of the other reviews...it sounds like some of the older physical infrastruture is showing its age. Evidently Hilton originally leased the land under the hotel from Puerto Rico....and finalized an agreement a few years ago to actually purchase the land. They are building new condo's on the hotel grounds which will be part of the Hilton. Next to that....as you look toward downtown...will be an upscale urban mall/shopping area, a casino....and eventually a \"river walk\" along the lagoon leading downtown and to the new Convention Center. We loved our stay at the Hilton and would definitely go back. A friend of ours always stays at the Ritz Carlton (near the airport) which seems (by the reveiws) to be the nicest hotel in San Juan. However, we wanted to be closer in town.",

        "content": "My boyfriend and I (both 26) stayed at this hotel for one night on July 31 before a cruise. When we booked the hotel in April we were worried because of reviews we saw here but we opted to stay here anyway and we were very happy we did. We arrived around 5pm and our room was not ready yet but we were able to check our bags and explore the grounds a bit and were given free drink coupons so we were not too bothered by our delay getting into our room. When the room was ready I was pleasently surprised that our particular room looked exactly like the pictures on the website and I honestly could not find one thing to complain about. The room and bathroom were clean, the AC worked great, the bed was very comfy, and we experienced no bad odors at all. We went to Old San Juan for dinner which was great but I cannot really comment on the quality/price of food at the hotel itself (I would highly recommend Buru though for great tapas in old san juan) The grounds were perfect. We quite enjoyed laying on a hammock on the beach late at night listening to the ocean while drinking mojitos! On Saturday we got up early and grabed coffee and a bite to eat at Starbucks which was in the lobby and then spent the morning on the beach which again was clean and perfect for getting some sun and having fun in the ocean. There are a few convienience type stores around the hotel as well as a Subway about a 3 minute walk away (a safe walk as well) Overall we were very impressed with this hotel and would have no problem recommending it to others to stay at before/after a cruise. However, I probably would not recommed it to business travelers who may not be taking in the outdoor ammenites that this hotel has to offer. The hotel did not really seem to have it's act together in terms of check-in but it didn't really bother us too much as we were on vacation and were not about to let a delay in getting to our room get us down. Also, families may want to beware because of the lack of affordable food near by.",

Taking cabs everywhere gets expensive so you are stuck eating all your meals in the hotel. Breakfast at the Palmeras was terrible and when I complained they didn't even offer a discount or take anything off the bill. Your better off getting a muffin at the Starbucks located in the lobby of the hotel and saving yourself $40.00 the Palmeras charges for breakfast! The room in the new tower was great (King Deluxe Plus) beautiful bathroom, great view from room 1767! The staff was helpful and quick to fix the clogged toilet in our room. I went to the Wyndam Condado Plaza for dinner and gambling one night and next time would probably stay there because it's in the middle of everything!

        "content": "I now understand the mixed reviews for at the Caribe Hilton. We stayed there pre-cruise and post-cruise recently - and what a difference 7 days made! The first night was \"fair\" - room was not ready well after check-in time but we were compensated with a drink on the house for our inconvenience. The bar service was very slow and what surprised me the most was that the servers at the bar were not allowed to handle cash and make change -- they had to take money to a cashier station to log their transaction before providing change - this made the process very tedious and slow -- this also designates that they have a trust issue with the bar staff - not good. The room was adequate - in the renovated tower, with sliding glass door and balcony with ocean view. Bed was very comfortable but leaking toilet kept us awake much of the night. Noticed peeling paint that was in need of repair. The service in the Palmeras restaurant that night was very good. Had an excellent cruise on Celebrity Constellation - topnotch service, all the way! What a downer to return to the Caribe Hilton post-cruise and experience an entirely different experience. The room was not ready (again) and this time no drink coupons (consistency?). We were in the \"old\" tower this time. The view was spectacular once again, however, what's with the old wooden rotted door from the 1950's leading our to the balcony? - and the rust stains on the carpet? - and more peeling paint? - (at least the toilet didn't leak this time) - but the bath was missing soap dish and more peeling paint in the bath area. In the hallway, there are housekeepers sitting on the floor. Dinner again at the Palmeras, but this time the service was awful. Server was rude and unattentive, but manager ended up comping our meal when we brought it to her attention. But the worst was yet to come: Upon returning to the room after an evening out in Old San Juan, went out on the balcony for a nightcap and a last look at the beautiful view. The old rotted wooden door closes behind us and LOCKS! - We are locked out on the 8th floor balcony at 4:00 am! - very scary, no one around, no security down below. We end up having to remove the old rotted panel at the bottom of the door to let ourselves back in. We call resident manager and ask to be moved to another room. They said they would patch up the door for the night instead. But after we explained all the other issues with our stay, we were moved to another room (in the \"new\" tower). I'll never forget the stay at Caribe Hilton and would never stay there again. (We paid $280/night for this) -- True, the view is beautiful and the landscaping was impressive - but isn't it what's inside that counts sometimes? and the staff? and the management? - that's what's lacking at Caribe Hilton.",

They just spent $60 million renovating the hotel but some sections of the hotel are still not quite up to date. The hotel has a nice beach and pool area but is not within walking distance of anything. Thats where the overpriced taxis come into play. If you must go to Puerto Rico, then this is a good choice among the hotels in San Juan (if you can get past the $18.50 breakfat buffet and $7 bottle of water from the mini bar). If you have an option go to the Dominican Republic or Mexico and spend 1/2 of the money on eveything.",

        "content": "I do not usually take the time nor feel compelled to write a review after a stay at a hotel but this time I do. This was my second time to visit Puerto Rico and I felt I had done my research about which hotels we might want to stay in as we wanted to stay in the Metro area. I had read a lot of the reviews on the Condado Hotel and felt there were more good ones than bad. I should have paid more attention to the bad ones. At least they fit our experience more than the good ones. We arrived on Sunday around 10:30 p.m. and I expected check in to go quickly as we had reservations and it was late in the evening. The hotel lobby looked as it had online in the photos. We had reserved a room with a private balcony overlooking the Atlantic with a king size bed. The room we were assigned had two double beds. So, down the slow elevators and back to the front desk where we had to wait to have this corrected. There were three people working the front desk, two of them were busy and the third one was staring at a computer screen and never looked up or asked us or anyone else if we needed help. So, we waited for the person that had originally helped us. The room assignment was corrected and we went back up to the new room. It was correct this time. The room also appeared as it had online but was not as clean as I had expected. The shower in the bathroom had mildew on the ceiling and the floor did not look vacuumed. The room also had a musty smell. There does not appear to be a ventilation fan in the bathroom. There was moisture on the window looking out to the balcony because of the humidity and you could see where some previous occupant of the room had written [--] You. You would think housekeeping could wipe the outside of the window between room occupants. The room seemed to be cleaned better after the first night. Note to traveler: make sure you put the â€œClean This Roomâ€� sign on your door when you leave your room in the morning. The other thing with housekeeping, which seemed to be the only friendly staff, was that they only put one wash cloth in the room everyday. There were two of us staying in the room and everyday I had to ask for another wash cloth. Back to the first 5 minutes in the room. We proceeded to get settled in the room and the power went out in the hotel. We were now standing in a dark room with just the glow through the window illuminating the room. I donâ€™t really blame this on the hotel but it was one of the first of many annoying things to come. After about 15 minutes of on again off again episodes and one scary moment of being stuck in the elevator for a brief moment power was restored. The pool area is ok but I have been to several that make this really rank. The pool is opened 24 hours but make sure you bring a towel from the room if you go down in the evenings or you will not have a towel They say they provide towels at the pool but the towel shack closes around 6:00 p.m. One night I had gone down to use the hot tub and lay by the pool and enjoy the moonlight and the sounds of the ocean and felt stalked by a security guard which kept looking and walking around me as if I didnâ€™t belong there. I almost confronted him and asked him to stop but decided to let it go. If you are going to have drinks at the pool bar be prepared to pay around $20 for two basic cocktails. Note to traveler: go to the store down the block and buy some rum, a bottle of coke and some plastic glasses and take your drink to the pool. Not one time did a waitress or waiter come over to ask if we needed a drink or anything. Another afternoon we had walked out to the pool area, set our things down and proceeded to the lagoon (beach) area to put our feet in the water and on the way back in we were stopped and asked to see the key card to our room to prove that we were hotel guest while other people just filed on by. Iâ€™m glad I had it in my swim suit pocket! I am 51 years old, clean cut and well dressed and had just walked out to the pool area from the hotel 5 minutes prior to this and he didnâ€™t say â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€� or explain why he was asking. Yes, I was insulted!!! After that we really didnâ€™t make use of the pool area. If you want to go to the beach go to Escambron, down the road towards Old San Juan, or Carolina beach in Isla Verde. Both are part of the Blue Flag program. If you go to El Yungue stop by Luquillo beach on your way back. We rented a car from Budget which is in the tower across the street also part of the Condado Hotel. The Budget Rental people were great. We got the car we wanted and quickly. We were able to return it at the airport which is what we wanted to do. Note to traveler: if you rent a car be prepared for the parking situation at the Condado. You have to take a ticket out of the machine to get in the parking garage, pray you can find a parking spot and then when you are ready to go out again you have to take it to the valet desk which is located outside in front of the hotel, write your room number, your name and sign it, hand it to a valet and get it validated and then go get your car out of the garage. You must do this every time you come and go which is very annoying! They do not explain this system well and sometimes it went smoothly and other times the person behind the parking desk acted like they didnâ€™t know what was going on and would tell you something completely different from what you had been doing. They tell you that in the end you will be charged a flat rate of $15.00 a day but this system does not instill confidence. We saw several people as confused as we were with the whole parking process. Also, just because you are a hotel guest does not mean you are guaranteed a parking space. There is an area designated for hotel guest but no one monitors who parks in these spots. If you come and go 3 to 4 times a day there are times you will return to the garage to see the â€œGarage Fullâ€� sign and have no option but to park down the street in a public lot or valet park at the hotel. We had no option but to valet park one time and when we came to get the car they didnâ€™t know where it was at first. Plus the valet parking rate is much more expensive. Note to traveler: if you have been out to a beach other than the one at the hotel there is no alternate elevator to your room you will have to go through the lobby. During the week with business men, etc. this can seem uncomfortable. We did not spend any time in the Casino as that is not our thing and we did not eat at the Strip House as we have one where we live. We did eat at the Italian restaurant which was not good. If you like Italian food donâ€™t get it here. You also can get breakfast in this same space in the morning and we ate breakfast twice and it was fine. If you like coffee, request the Puerto Rican coffee otherwise they bring regular coffee. We did try the bar but after no wait person came to take our order we went up to the bar to order and the bartender just continued to talk to someone and ignored us even after saying â€œcan we get a drink?â€� We gave up at that point. Another annoying thing at this hotel is the doors to the rooms. It is impossible to close them without a loud slam and I mean loud. So, early mornings and late evenings you are aware of the comings and goings of other guests while you are sleeping or relaxing in your own room. In general, I felt the staff was rude and unaccommodating. I think this is more of a business and convention hotel than a vacationing one. Based on our experience I was expecting check out to be an unpleasant experience and to our surprise it wasnâ€™t. We were in a long line waiting to get to the front desk when a very nice, official looking hotel representative asked if anyone was checking out and we indicated we were. He assisted us and even showed us where we could print our boarding passes for our flight home. This was the first time I felt we received the kind of service I had expected the 5 nights we stayed considering the quality and rating this hotel has or professes to have. Friday morning there was a political figure in town in addition to the people arriving at the hotel for the weekend and it really seemed like hotel staff had a wake up call. They even started to say â€œthank youâ€�. I know we were staying at this hotel during the â€œoff seasonâ€� but service is service. The second day of our trip we decided to salvage our vacation mood by lowering our expectations and proceeded to have a good vacation. I feel if we had stayed somewhere else we might have had a great vacation. I would not stay here again. Next time we will stay at one of the Isla Verde hotels or one of the resort hotels.",

        "content": "The Condado was an excellent hotel. I would recommend the hotel and stay there again. I originally had the city view and upgraded to an ocean view. It was worth it, if you love the breeze and view of the ocean. The hotel staff was wonderful, not only with things in the hotel but with information about the city. The hotel has a nice swimming pool area (2 pools) and a nice little beach. The beach is not that big but much larger beaches are in walking distance. The hotel casino is small compared to the hotels in Vegas, but for the guest staying at the hotel and others visiting it is more than big enough. Although they play music every night, if you want to go dancing you will have to probably leave the hotel and find another location. Overall I would stay there again with no hesitation. It is a beautiful hotel and the staff is great.",

The hotel is totally new and modern, our room faced the ocean and was clean and beautiful. So you're good to go with the hotel. Things to know... - There is a \"beach\" on the property but it's like a little lagoon. I wouldn't go to San Juan for the beaches anyway, but the hotel has several really nice pools - Condado is a nice area, cabs to old San Juan, etc can get pricey. We didn't realize it's about $12-15 one way to get to old San Juan! Cheaper than parking though - The hotel was great about holding our things while we toured after we checked out, and if we were staying longer there are cool bars there as well...and a georgeous huge deck that would have been a great place for cocktails if we weren't sunburned and tired!!! Overall great, clean, affordable, more than you'd expect for the $$ and well worth it!",

        "content": "It's the lack of service that kills this place. Everything else is pretty great. The place looks sharp. Kudos to whoever designed the renovation - it's sultry and chic. The location is great. The price is reasonable. But the service... They kick you out of your beach chairs to stack them up at 5:00 when there are still plenty of people enjoying them. The beach is $@!#% but it would still be okay if they serviced it. We waited an hour for our drinks the 1st day. After waiting an hour the 2nd day, we went up to the bar to get them ourselves only to find out the orders were never placed. This is where the service starts to really rank. I made a comment that the drinks really should be on the house at this point and was told to go speak to the manager which we did. He didn't apologize and he didn't comp us either. He asked us where we were sitting on the beach which led us to believe he would follow up with a round on the house. Nada. This ticked me off so I mentioned it at checkout. The woman at the desk called over and was told he would do nothing for us. I could've probably swallowed that if he'd have schmoozed out some kind of apology but we didn't even get that. The desk clerk suggested I complain on the online survey which I did and received ABSOLUTELY NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. You can not claim to pride yourself on customer service if you do not even respond to a specific complaint. There is too much competition to be that lacking in customer courtesy and it's really too bad because I would have made this my go to place in Puerto Rico.",

Very dissaponted, will never stay here again, 4 star hotel with 1 star staff. So, if you have money ready to be stolen from the comfort of your room while you are out and about, this is the hotel for you. management gave us the run around until we check out with no resolution. other guest got their jewerly stolen in the same week, just prior to check out. Loved Puerto Rico but hated the stayed. If you must go, please, please stay somewhere else. Loved the island and all the activities, people out and about are very helpful and you can find your way around. The food is great and very affortable but you have to drive outside the \"tourist\" area. great beaches and natural resources that PR provide are second to none. come to PR for a great time, but staye else where! do your homework and plan your trip carefully. as for me and my family will never, ever stay here and will advise everyone not to stay at the intercontinental.",

We were upgraded to an ocean view room upon arrival. The ocean view is SPECTACULAR! You can see the neat, tropical pool area too. We were offered early check-in, pretty much as soon as we arrived from the airport. The room was the perfect size for a couple, chicly decorated, and although they did miss a day or two of cleaning it, housekeeping responded promptly to all of our requests. Pluses: Beautiful hotel, very clean, wonderful service from bell boys to housekeeping to concierge, several on-site restaurants and bars, great TVs in rooms, near a couple cute places like Lupis down the street, and fun/large pool area Minuses: Sub-par food at all the restaurants including room service food, WAY OVERPRICED food and drink (just don't plan to eat and drink within the hotel unless you like $15 made-from-frozen hamburgers and $10 vodka-cranberries), not the most glamorous or convenient location (cost us $22 minimum to take a cab anywhere we wanted to go - there just isn't much to do in this part of San Juan) Overall we had a romantic, lovely time, felt like we got a relatively good deal (paid $2300 total for the two of us for 4 nights/5 days - included airfare, hotel, food/drink while there, cab rides, and a kayaking trip), and would return!",

Fair prices considering your at a resort. The waitresses and waiters was all friendly and courteous. The Pina Colada's were excellent.......Waleska made the best. The hotel was a little to quite for me and the casino was small and had out dated slot machines. We stayed in a suite which was nice and clean, but small compared to many suites I have seen. There was no tub, which in my opinion is not a suite. All the suites only had a city view with a very small balcony not big enogh for a small table or chair. And with having a city view suite there is not much privacy because you are on the front entrance side of the hotel and there is alot of traffic in and out of the hotel. There are plenty of places outside the resort to get food at a great price. Not sure of the exact name but I believe it's called Misa Casa ( great food /great price) which is in th shopping center across the street from resort. There is also a nice small sushi bar about a block up the street that served excellent sushi and the miso soup was to die for. I visited a few other hotels in the immediate area and found the El San Juan was the place to be to hang out on the weekends. All in all it was a good stay, I will return to Puerto Rico but probably will choose another hotel.",

        "content": "My wife and I stayed at the InterContinental from 4/1/08 to 4/6/08 and had the best time. We got a room on the 5th floor facing the pool and it was great. We were not too concerned about the room location since we were not planning on staying in the room all day. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm and were checked in right away even though check-in is usually at 4pm. The bell boy brought up the bags promptly and we were off to the beach and pool almost immediately. The pool and beach is excellent at this hotel. You have to get a wrist band in order to get towels & pillows and it also identifies you as a guest of the hotel when on the beach. The pool area has tents with chairs that can be reserved a day earlier or taken on a first come first serve basis. All the hotel staff was very courteous and helpful throughout our stay and we had no complaints at all. The concierge at the hotel was very helpful in providing us with directions and recommendations during our stay there. The restaurants on site were expensive and so was room service. Prior to visiting Puerto Rico my wife and I decided to only consume local cuisine so we didnâ€™t ever eat at the hotel. The hotel itself has a Steak House, an Italian Restaurant & a Japanese Restaurant. The pool side bar and the beach front cafe were also pretty expensive. Please note that the beach front cafe is cheaper than the pool side bar even though they are only a few feet away from each other. I basically went to the small supermarket directly in front of the hotel and grabbed some Medalla Light (local) beer and brought it to the room and put it in the fridge. I then took it down to the pool and beach in a plastic cup. The same beer 10oz costs $4 at the hotel while the super market sells it for $1.25. The security at the hotel was very good and the pool and beach guard (Mike) is very friendly. We rented a car for our stay from Alamo and I chose to use the self parking option. Since parking is scarce in the area, all hotels charge for parking. At the InterContinental they charge $16 for self parking and $22 for valet. The self parking lot is across the street from the hotel but itâ€™s not a problem at all to use. Some people have mentioned concern about crossing the street. We live in the NJ/NY area and crossing the streets in our areas is pretty similar so it wasnâ€™t a big deal for us. If you want to have some local fare walk over to Mi Casita directly in front of the hotel. Itâ€™s a small place with a small menu but the food is excellent. Another restaurant in walking distance is Metropol. They have Puerto Rican and Cuban food and is excellent as well. We went to Metropol twice during our stay. We went to Old San Juan a few times (for meals and sightseeing). It was convenient to have a car. I used my blackberry and Google maps (gps) to help me with the directions. All road signs are in Spanish so a GPS will really help. Some restaurants that we tried in Old San Juan are, Tantra (Indo-Latino fusion), Dragonfly (Latino-Asian Fusion) and Cafeteria Mallorca (located on Calle San Francisco in Old San Juan) typical local restaurant - they have some really good rice dishes and a chicken soup that local crave for. Another must visit restaurant is Ajili Mojili (1006, Ashford Avenue San Juan, PR 00907 Puerto Rico). Itâ€™s located in Condado (between Isle Verde and Old San Juan). They have the best Mofongo and Asapao (local delicacies). Day trips we did: El Yunque Rain Forest - I even took a dip under the water fall after the 30 min hike. ATV tours at Hacienda Carabali - Ask the concierge for the directions to this place. We did the 2 hour ATV tour and it was awesome. They even stopped at a river and we were able to jump in. They are located between the El Yunque Rain Forest and Luquillo Beach. Luquillo Beach - One of the best beaches in PR. Itâ€™s located a miles past the road to the El Yunque Rain Forest towards Fajardo. Try out some local food at the Luquillo Beach food kiosks. If you are going to the above mentioned 3 places I recommend that you take the 187 road. This is the most scenic way towards Fajardo. You will also pass some unique local kiosks with food and drinks (try some coco - coconut water). Old San Juan - Takes about a full day to view the whole town and all the fortresses, etc. We will definitely go back to PR and stay at the InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa & Casino. Have fun!",

        "content": "My stay and interaction with the Intercontinental was one of business. I had the task of researching for a place to hold my company's convention. I found the Intercontinental. I was flown down there, all expenses paid, for 3 nights to take a look at the property. I then also stayed there for another 3 nights during our convention. I was there on business for the first trip so I was treated like royalty. Meals prepared from the Head Chef, one of their nicer rooms, a private dinner on the beach along the boardwalk, complimentary trips off the property, meeting with management etc... Everyone there was beyond nice and professional. Now I know this is not the treatment most people will get, but it is certainly a reflection on how they treat their customers and the pride that they take in their property. Top notch employees all around. My room on this trip was in the \"club\" house. It overlooked the pool area (which was still a good view cause the pool is awesome). The room was great. The marbled bathroom, the large fluffy bed, the sitting area, the deck. This area also has a private dining space for the club members. Breakfast is served here as well as appetizers from 5pm-7pm. My second stay was more normal with no special treatment. My room was a regular room in the hotel. I did get beach views, which was gorgeous. The room itself is your standard hotel room. It is very clean however. The property is amazing. It sits right on the beach. The beach is public, but they do have people that make sure not just anybody wanders onto the property. The pool area is great too. Palm trees, and a swim up bar, another regular bar, a huge hot tub. There is a \"rock wall\" type thing in the pool with a waterfall coming down. It definately sets that tropical feel and makes your stay all the more relaxing. The staff for the pool area are also awesome and extremely nice. The steps out of the hotel leading to the pool are a grand staircase that makes you feel like you are Scarlet O'Hara at the beach making your grand entrance. I am not much for gambling and didn't spend tons of time in the casino. I can't really compare it to any other casino cause I have never really been! But it had slot machines, black jack, poker tables etc... and all the bright, flashing lights you would expect. The whole hotel is very nice. Marble everywhere. It just has presence. There are several hotels on the property including a Ruth Chris, an Italian restaurant that just opened when I was there. It was a top notch high end restaurant. We met the Chef as her personally came out to our table. A great meal. One of the best I have ever had. The also have a Japanese restaurant on the premise. All of them are pretty expensive, but the food reflects that price. If your company is planning a convention or retreat I would highly recommend this location. I would also recommend it for your next PR vacation.",

        "content": "My stay at the Intercontinental Hotel San Juan was for 2 nights on September 14, 2007, for a pre-cruise stay. I arrrived into San Juan in the late afternoon, took the fixed rate taxi to the hotel, and was greeted warmly by the bell staff as they did each and every time I entered or departed the hotel. I was effeciently and pleasantly checked into my room #1123 by the front desk clerk. This very nice service is what I had remembered from a previous stay at another San Juan hotel, but, unfortunately this is where the friendly service ended at the Intercontinental San Juan. My room, although small, was cheerfully decorated and the bed was fluffy and comfortable with the bottom sheet completely covering the matress. The small balcony overlooked the street area and airport landing traffic (no problem with noise). I immediately noticed that the room contained nice bathroom amenities and plenty of towels, but, none of the usual Room Service Menu/Service Directory/Writing Paper portfolio. The room also had an ironing board but no iron. In calling for these items, I was told that the iron would be sent up but I would have to call the Business Center for the portfolio. Okay fine. Business Center says call Housekeeping, each time being asked, \"Anything else I can do for you?\" To me, this is the most frustrating situation with Customer Service. If you haven't been able to fullfill my request, don't ask if you can do anything else. I decided it was not that important to get the portfolio. As it turned out the iron was broken, but, was replaced quickly the next day. After a very long trip, I went to bed early but was awakened by loud voices in the hallway, mistaken phone calls and knocking at the door. After falling asleep again, I was awakened again by the 3 false fire alarms mentioned by a previous review. The next night did go much better with no alarms! My room was made up the second day very promptly after leaving for lunch and the Housekeeping department was quiet and unobtrusive. As mentioned in previous reviews,the beach at the Intercontinental is very nice and the hotel has great service for guests who wish to be served while in the sun. The pool is also very nice and security is tight, making it difficult for anyone who is not a regestered guess to be admitted. The gym is well-equipped, adequately air conditioned,and has a nice view of the beach, and is open 24-hours. The ice machine on my floor worked well and always had plenty of ice. As I stay in hotels about 12 nights a month, I have to say that the young lady at check out gets the award for the worst in the world. She was curt, rude, and did not even offer to show me a list of my charges prior to charging my card. She had no change in cash to accommodate my request for small bills acting as if this was a strange request for a hotel cashier. No thank you's or offers of assistance with bags from her. All of this after waiting 5 minutes for other clerk on duty to finish her personal conversation with a co-worker. All in all, this hotel is quite a blast from the past. I fully expected to see Lucy, Ethel, Fred and Ricky pass through the lobby while on their \"Puerto Rican Adventure.\" Truely a place where my Mom and Dad would have spent their honeymoon. Not a bad thing if staff could be brought up-to-date on current standards of service in the hotel industry.",

We went to the Ritz Carlton to check it out and it wasn't as nice as the intercontinental. It was so stark in it's gardens. The outside was plain, MUCH smaller beach than ours. By far the intercontinental was much nicer. Always security around but you didn't notice them. I would go back in a heatbeat. I have been to MANY islands and this is on the top of my list. Much to see and do there. Great pool, restaurants. You MUST make this a place to visit.",

They were the reason our stay was extra special. A week before arrival they made arrangements for several tours. Our second night in San Juan was my wife's birthday and they suggested Aguaviva and took care of the details for us, the restaurant was excellent. They assisted several times with directions and getting our boarding passes when the hotel's internet service was down. Five starts for concierge's. Dinner at the restaurant was very good and priced competitively. The hotel is close to everything in Old San Juan. We only had two minor issues, one was internet service, it was not available for most of the stay and had to have our boarding passes faxed to the hotel after using a cell phone to check in, which to say the least was painful. The second was breakfast. The buffet offered did not live up to the $20.00 per person. Our breakfast there was $50.00 with the tip and tax while a short walk to local eateries was one-fifth the price and just as good.",

The food was well prepared and the room service staff was very good. Security was good in that all guests needed to use their room cards for elevator access to room floors. The casino clientel was a little trashy. I did not enjoy using the casino. Viewing the cruise ships from the 9th floor pool area was great. Especially as they came in or departed. At ground level the ships are closer than anywhere else I've been. Great photo ops. Two blocks behind the hotel is a restaurant street with lots of local fair with entertainment. Many have outside dining and the atmosphere was great. All of Old San Juan is walkable from this hotel. Note: There is a CVS just down the street to buy beer, wine, sodas, water, and snacks. You will save significant amounts. Other people have complained about the mold. The stairs area near the pool was bad. Our room on the 8th floor was fine. The elevator area on the room floors had minor mold. The meeting areas were fine. The wi-fi was spotty. Good at times, connection issues at other times. Overall-marginal. The price was high but expected based on the location.",

        "content": "Just back from a lovely time in old San Juan. We got a good price at the Sheraton on Priceline. I was a little unsure of the location due to the proximity to the cruise ships. and the possibility of being overrun by passengers every time we stepped out the door. It never was a problem. In fact I enjoyed looking out and seeing which ship was in every day. I found the location so central to all of old San Juan that I'd choose it again for just that reason. Every staff person we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. We had a standard room, and it was fine. It isn't shiny new, and the furniture was dark old wood of the West Indies style. I liked it all. The beds were very comfy and house keeping did a good job of cleaning and fulfilling any requests we had. In the room, I never heard other guests except the ones in the halls who appeared to be returning from late night partying. It feels like on weekends all of the island comes to town, so there is probably noise everywhere. My suggestion would be to join them and walk around the old town as late as you want. Around the hotel feels very safe, as does all the town within the confines of the tourist areas. The gym was adequate. It was nice to look out over the sea from the treadmills. The pool is small, as others have reported. Not having gone on vacation to swim, I didn't mind. I felt I could have done some laps had I been inclined to -just short ones.The few times we went up to sit by the pool there were chairs open, and it was peaceful. I imagine if a large family came in it would feel a bit crowded. I do like a bit of slot playing, but it didn't take more than one night to find I wasn't going to be lucky in the casino. It's small, and has less choices than I'm accustomed to. Maybe give it an evening if you like. The locals go there and are fun to chat with. I learned from them that while playing the machines, you can order not only free drinks, but free sandwiches as well. They were having some sort of ham and cheese cooked things that might make a nice snack for the price of a tip. If you aren't driving, skip this part...We rented a car to get out and see more of the island. To avoid the $21.40/nt valet parking, we parked on the street. Coming back in the day time, there was usually a spot within a block of the hotel. You have to look closely, because it's illegal to park where the curb has yellow or blue paint. You will see many people park there anyway, and I don't know how many tickets were written. At night, there are various fellows who stand on the curbs and direct people into parking spaces. They will guide you in as if they are teaching you to parallel park for the first time, then they stand near waiting for a dollar or two tip. We questioned one man after we parked and realized the curb was yellow. He assured us the police didn't give tickets at night for parking there. We moved the car shortly anyway, and soon saw a ticket being written to someone else nearby, so - do it at your own risk. On the weekend, the city seems to fill up and make street parking at less available. We ended up valet parking Friday and Saturday night. There are 2 or 3 parking garages near the hotel. Short term, they seem like a decent price, but it's unclear about the pricing for 24 hr parking.Check before you enter and have to pay to leave if you change your mind. We didn't find a garage that was less than the valet for our needs. We did do some driving in and around town. I wouldn't have had the patience for it had i been on my own, but my friend drives regularly in London and found it manageable. If you can't decide about getting a car, you can walk all over old town and just rent when you want to get out of town. The major touristy sites out of SJ also have tours to take you if you don't want to drive.There's a Hertz office in the Sheraton. We took a taxi to Coronado one evening so we could drink, and it was $12 one way and $15 back. Taxi to airport from the hotel was $21. If you are going to the Sheraton pre-cruise, do your research and see where your ship docks. You may be able to just cross the street and board, but if it's farther down the docks, you may choose a short taxi ride. As for the restaurants in the hotel, there were so many others we wanted to try, we didn't eat there except for a quick burger. It was just that - a burger. Nothing more. I recommend getting up and walking the city early while it's cool, or near sunset. There is so much to see and if you get lost, just head downhill toward the docks and you'll find the Sheraton. No matter where you choose to stay, do get out and soak in the charm and color of old San Juan.",

        "content": "The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is across the street from San Juan bay. A short walk takes one into the heart of old San Juan and all the cafÃ©s, restaurants, night spots, small museums and historic spots. The problems with this hotel are mostly due to historic reasons. The fact that the building in which its housed goes back to a different area and wasn't meant as a hotel means that it has no parking of its own. There is, however, a municipal parking across the street at the side of the building, and another a block away. Rates are quite reasonable (Don't use the hotel's valet parking. They use the very same municipal parking, but charge four times as much!). Also because of cramped space, amenities are on the smallish size, but quite adequate. For example, the pool is on the roof and not large, meant to dip in, not swim. On the other hand, they've made it pleasant. On the bright side, they've used their imagination to squeeze in as many amenities as possible in the cramped space. Thus, in addition to the pool, the hotel has a comparatively large fitness room, a restaurant, conference rooms, a bar-and-burger joint and, of course, the casino. The decor is simple, but nice. Very simple, the color schemes being bright pastels (Y'know, the whole tropical thing). Room furniture is on the theme of the austere, dark Spanish colonial look, simple but quite adequate. I personally liked it. The room is comfortably sized. Air conditioned worked fine (A blessing in the tropics), the bathroom larger than in most hotels and well appointed. The whole of the hotel was kept very clean. Tickets were given to me when I checked in for a full buffet breakfast free, with waffles and omelettes cooked to order. There were enough for me and my daughter to cover every morning of our stay. The food was good, the service personnel very pleasant. Rates were reasonable, particularly so for Puerto Rico and especially considering the hotel's location. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return.",

        "content": "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Old San Juan Hotel & Casino. I must say, the location is spectacular, if you are looking to really experience old San Juan. It's situated near the ocean and some of the historic sites. I was there on business, but because of its location, I was able to see some of the sites at the same time as taking my meetings. It's near the main highways to get around in the city. That said, the hotel is in some serious need of renovation. I found my room to be depressing. My bed was extremely comfortable, heaven actually, but the furniture in the room bothered me. It felt cheap. Uninspired decor left me less than impressed. There was also a very strange smell in the room, like shower curtain that has remained wet for days and never dried kind of smell. A muggy, mildewey smell is the best way to describe it. The front desk staff was ok. I didn't find them to go above and beyond the call of duty to make me feel welcome. I also felt like they were under staffed at front desk and not very knowledgeable of procedure. My checkout lasted almost 30 mins due to some printing issue. Room service gal was awesome. All in all, the location is AMAZING and highly recommend it for that alone. You can walk to the beautiful old town (and Starbucks). As for the guestrooms, the bed was amazing, but I was very unhappy with the rest of the decor and bulky furniture.",

They stored our luggage and took my cell number to call us when the room was ready. We had a room by 1pm and were upgraded to a Jr. Suite. Rooms are OK. No fridge or mini-bar which I would expect in a higher level hotel. Biggest complaint was that the gym was closed for renovation, which meant the pool was also closed. It was obsecenely hot in Puerto Rico and a pool would have been nice. Did not eat in the fancy restaurant but did eat at Chicago Burger Co., which is attached to the hotel. Good burger but pricey.

So I went to the next street, found a parking lot and parked there. The next day when we left, we found the parking fee is $42! It is actually a public parking lot and have no contract with the hotel. Maybe we went to the wrong parking lot but the hotel should have given a more clear guidance because we are not familiar to this area. The other services are really good. The front desk girl upgraded our room to a suite, with great location and view. I will come to the hotel again but I prefer not driving there.",

        "content": "I stayed here for one month with my husband who was in San Juan for business. The best things about this hotel is its location in Old San Juan and the staff. You can walk everywhere in Old San Juan easily and the hotel is right on the bay so some rooms have nice bay views and the patios of the restaurants have great ocean views of all the cruise ships coming and going. The staff overall was wonderful, friendly and very helpful-especially JANMARILY at the front desk and ALEX and LUIS who worked in both restaurants. The housekeeping staff was wonderful as well and if you put the sign on your door that you weren't interested in service, they actually respected that and did not come in. Often I would pass them in the hall and they would offer extra towels or see if there was anything we needed. Top notch housekeeping and I felt very comfortable that my things were safe in the room (unlike other places I have stayed in Puerto Rico). Negatives were there is no real hotel room service, only from the restaurants which are at the hotel, one being a burger place (mediocre at best) and one a more expensive Italian restaurant. The room service food available during the day is very limited and they stop at 11pm at night. Both restaurants are also pretty slow so don't go if you are starving. However the happy hour offered at the Italian restuarant, Il Palacio I think it was called, is great-VERY affordable drinks and appetizers. My other complaints were the water in the shower never held its temperature- it would go back and forth between hot and cold during every shower (and we stayed in 3 different rooms) and also half the equipment in the gym was broken or needed maintenance. These aren't the worst things to find in a hotel so overall I am giving them a good rating.",

        "content": "My husband and I traveled to Puerto Rico over Christmas and stayed at the Sheraton Old San Juan for 5 days because of it's location which is awesome! We used it as a base to explore and drive around the whole island during the day, then we could park the car and walk all over Old San Juan exploring some really amazing restaurants, bars and shops. It would also be the perfect location pre or post cruise. That said, I wouldn't consider it anything more than basically a place to sleep. Our room was on a higher floor overlooking the docks where the cruise ships come in which was scenic but the room itself is plain but serves it's purpose. The hotel is older so the elevators are small, there's only 2 and they are slow. Be prepared for hordes of pre and post cruisers checking in with tons of luggage into the really small lobby, but considering the amount of turn over and 1 night stays this hotel has, I think they do a pretty good job. We checked out the casino which is small but ok for trying out a couple of slot machines. The only other thing is the hotel is impossible to find if you're not familiar with the area. It took us over an hour to get to the hotel from the airport when it should have taken about 15 minutes (granted it was at night). All the directions you get ahead of time seem easy enough but the words on the directions don't match the freeway signs and when you actually get into Old San Juan there's alot of one way streets that get confusing. There was no signage at street level, only at the very top of the hotel. But getting lost makes things memorable right?!?!",

        "content": "We reserved the OSJ Sheraton for 2 days before our Carnival Victory Southern Caribbean cruise at the end of Nov 2010. We reserved the room through Hotwire for about $125 a night. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is only a couple of blocks from the pier that our shipped docked at, so we were able to walk our backs from the hotel directly to the ship at boarding time (saving an extra taxi fee). Pros: Great beds â€“ very comfortable and large. Good air conditioning in our room. Very close to the free trolley pickup (which can take you around Old San Juan). Close to some of the better restaurants. Close to Senor Frogâ€™s and a CVS drugstore. Has hard-wired internet service. Hertz rental car facility in main lobby. Cons: A little noisy at night (depending on your room location). No continental breakfast. Casino is pretty small but takes up a good bit of the lobby floor space. Brumbaugh Street (in front of hotel) is completely congested with traffic at rush hour and cruise docking times. It can take 20 minutes for a car to travel 200 ft. at these times (including the free trolley). Not much parking space. If you have a car, I recommend using the parking garage across the street â€“ much cheaper than the valet service. When we arrived, the reception desk was very friendly & helpful. We arrived at a slow time, but I assume that if you were to check-in at the busy time (when the ship is boarding/docking), the friendliness would be replaced with more of a hurry-up attitude. They were very busy on Sunday morning between 10:30 â€“ 1:00. We had called the hotel in advance and asked them if we could check-in early (normal check-in is 3:00). They noted this and allowed us to check-in around 12:30 when we arrived. The entrance to the hotel is on the side of the building. Check-out is 11:00, but the official boarding time for the ship was ~ 2:30. The bellhops will watch your luggage from 11:00 to whenever you want to board (suggested tip 5-7$) which gives you some extra time to see Old San Juan before you have to board. Hotel has a nice sized exercise room and pool on the top floor. You can see a lot of the harbor and city from the top floor lookout. Although the hotel was nice, it was barely worth the above mentioned Hotwire price ($125 and no continental breakfast???). I certainly would not pay the $200 normal price. If you are taking the Carnival Victory on a southern Caribbean Cruise, this hotel is a good location for you. See attached pictures for more.",

Our luggage was sent up to our room in the next elevator after us. We stayed one night prior to a Carnival cruise and chose this hotel only because we could walk our bags across to the port. You are only able to walk to the Carnival port, if I was taking another cruise line, I would stay elsewhere and cab it. The staff was friendly and as accomidating as they could be. Rooms were clean and ours didn't have a view, but than again we didn't pay for one. I feel they do upgrade you and are nicer when they are less crowded. It seems at times they don't have enough staff working to accomidate the crowds and a lot of tension comes from that. Also, they only have 2 elevators so it takes a lot of time to get to and from your room and we happened to be on the 9th floor, so taking the stars each time was not always an option. We had them hold our bags after we checked out and it did take about 30 minutes for them to bring them to us. The hotel was a mad house sunday from about 1030A and it still was when we left at 1230p. I'm use to paying alot for drinks, I live in Chicago, however the drinks in the Burger place were outrageous and most of what we had were the local beer.",

        "content": "The Sheraton Old San Juan exceeded my expectations in most areas. We arrived mid-day on a Friday. Check in was a little disorganized due to simultaneous, convoluted problems with two group check-ins. However, our king suite was exactly as billed and our Starwood points were properly credited. We were on the 4th floor and had a great view of the bay and any cruise ships that came in. I would note that the balconies that come with the rooms are tiny. One or two people can stand outside the doors; otherwise you need to leave doors open if you want to have a chair in the balcony area. Our suite was spacious and very clean, with the usual Sheraton bed and amenities. We set out to hit the town right away, and discovered the biggest drawback of the hotel - - the elevators. The one on the right only worked intermittently, and they both were pretty slow. We tried to use the stairs with mixed results. One stairway led us to the street; another required us to exit through the restaurant's kitchen. The Sheraton's location can't be beat. We were a half block from Senior Frog's. Given the strength of the drinks there, that is the maximum you should try to walk afterwards. P.S., while Senor Frog's makes a lot of of drinks with a specific purpose in mind (incapacitating the customers), I got a great 1800/Grand Marnier tequila there, and thoroughly enjoyed the antics. A lot of locals go there, and I noticed most of them wisely stick to beer. Some of the best restaurants, Parrot Club, Aquaviva, and Dragonfly, are only a couple of blocks away, and we walked virtually everywhere in Old San Juan, including the El Morrow Fort. There is also a nice brew pub/steak house (Old Harbor) that is only a few blocks away. Cafe El Bombenara was an amazing old school place, with fantastic cafe con leche and great malloracs. We stayed here three days and I can't imagine a better place to stay to explore this area. There are also taxis aplenty, so commuting to other areas is easy as well. I enjoyed the Sheraton's Casino a lot. The drinks are free and they have abundant and vibrant live entertainment at night. Also, there are a lot of locals who come here and the scene is great. I just played slots and found them to be pretty fair. The pool is small, but it's located on the roof and has great views. It is a fun area during the day, and you pick up on the excitement of people waiting to go on cruises and get advice from those who just came back. Our favorite nightspot was the Parrot Club, which had the best drinks in town (we put this matter to the test). The signature Parrot Punch was very good, but the mojitos were beyond compare. Our bartender, Anthony, could well be dubbed the Ambassador for Puerto Rico. My wife and I have never met a friendlier person in all our travels, and he made fantastic drinks and guided us through the menu with aplomb. His insights on both the area and country were much appreciated. We loved the food at Aquaviva. This is a great seafood place with an intimate atmosphere and good vibe. Check out was a breeze, and our bill was accurate. Enjoy this place. I have tried to accurately convey the details, but really the overall experience was great. If you want to stay at the Ritz and lounge on a beach; stay at the Ritz If you want to see Old San Juan or take a cruise, the Sheraton can't be beat for its location.",

        "content": "This hotel is pretty mid-level. Although our stay included some hotel related injuries, the location is prime. We picked the hotel because of its close proximity to the pier (as we were taking a cruise). The location is perfect if you plan to take a cruise sailing out of old San Juan, as it is literally steps away from the pier. This was highly convenient. The bar and gill attached to the hotel and casino is great. They have great drinks, but the service is slow. Its a nice place to read a book or lounge around and people watch (when you aren't in a hurry). We actually ended up spending about 3 or 4 hours there after we checked out of our room (and we didn't want to wait in line to get on our cruise). While the wait staff is on the slow side, they make up for it with unexpected attentiveness- i.e. going out of their way to light your cigarette for you. The casino was sub-par. Not very interesting and I was nearly accosted by an over-zealous security guard who wanted to check my ID. He kept saying \"ID! ID!\" and then when I said I was staying in the hotel and started to look through my handbag for my ID and room key, he \"Puh!\"-ed me away and shoo-ed me. The gaming is just not worth it at this casino. The picture of the roof top pool are pretty deceptive. Its TINY, but has a good view. As always, with a hotel, watch out for the hot tub. My party and I went up all geared up for a soak, only to find a nasty couple making out in there and god knows what else yuk- so we didn't go in. BEWARE OF DOOR STOPS OUTSIDE THE BATHROOMS! Two people in my party were injured (one VERY badly). The door stops outside of the bathrooms were placed WAY too far out from the wall. We had to put the ice bucket over it since everyone kept tripping over the stupid thing. The rooms were just Meh. We had a wonderful view of a parking garage from our window. The room was clean, but nothing special at all, just your run of the mill bland, exactly what you expect from an airport hotel. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Also we enjoyed the bell boys, they were very friendly and gave lots of good advice.... Also if you stay in this hotel, you MUST MUST MUST eat dinner at Aquaviva (a few blocks behind the hotel). One of the best meals of my life!",

        "content": "My stay at the Sheraton Old San Juan was very comfortable. The cleanliness, quality of the linens and furnishings, spaciousness of the rooms, were all that I would expect of a Sheraton. It was well-air conditioned and I slept very well here. Since this is not a resort hotel and not near the beach most vacationers would probably choose it only if they wanted to experience old San Juan, visiting the forts and walking the old cobble stoned streets. I would rate it as excellent for business travelers except for the trouble that I had with their high speed Internet connection. I had to be moved once because the Internet wasn't working in my original room. Then when it was working I couldn't access our Exchange e-mail server. The help desk said this was normal because the hotel did not have a mail relay setup. Not being able to access my e-mail made my business travel more stressful than it needed to be. Dinner from room service was excellent. Try the restaurant Baru if you stay here. It is within easy walking distance if you are wearing comfortable shoes (those cobblestones).",

The rooms are spacious and come equip with beds that you can adjust. The view from the room I was in had a panoramic view of the Walt Disney World Fireworks. Although a stone's throw away from Disney it is set in a quiet area of Lake Buena Vista away from the tourist traffic. I would recommend this hotel to anyone with Hilton Honors or someone who wants a luxury stay without the luxury price. Well done Garden Inn at Lake Buena Vista you have outdone yourself.",

        "content": "Lived up to the hype! We stayed from the 5th-19th May for our honeymoon and highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro.Transfer time from Punta Cana airport 30-45mins. Getting through the airport was less painful than anticipated. We purchased our tourist cards in advance, but it cost twice as much. It did not seem any hassle at all to buy them at the airport upon arrival, which is what we wish we had done.Check in at the hotel was smooth, complete with Banana Mama upon arrival. We rented a safe in our suite for $2 a day.The junior suite was very impressive. I think we may have been lucky enough to get a recently refurbished room, no musty smells, air con worked fine, beds huge and very comfortable. Good size bathroom with separate shower cubicle and bath.Our suite was perfectly located for both the pool and beach. Blocks (which house 8 suites each) numbered 234,235 and 236 are in the same area. We were in 2365, a ground floor suite. 5 minute stroll to the lobby, bars and buffet/restaurants.Its worth tipping the maid a dollar a day, it keeps the minibars well stocked with what we wanted and we are convinced that the lovely little touches the maid did to the room were as a result of tipping.Staff are friendly and helpful, good levels of service, it was near impossible to have an empty glass. Make sure you tip for good service, make the effort to pick up a few words in Spanish, it makes a big difference.We confirm that pathways are hazardous when wet. My wife tells me the paths are not for high heels, flat shoes are the way to go.Grounds are stunning and impeccably maintained and contain amazing wildlife.Huge pool with complete with swim up bar. The swim up section of the pool (about one third of the area of the pool) was closed for refurbishment from the 4th day and this was still going on when we left. It was disappointing, but its an all year round resort, so it has to be done at some point and I guess as the low season has just got underway and the rainy season is coming it seems a sensible time to do such work.Beach is by far the best we have encountered, a tropical paradise. No trouble getting a palapa, but if you insist on a front row palapa, get there by 9-9.30.Breakfast and lunch buffets are of good standard. For lunch, the poolside buffet offers a wider selection. We found the evening buffet below par. However we both suffered with stomach problems which took the edge of our appetite and could well have clouded our judgement and we may have been over critical because of this. Stomach problems or not the Gourmet restaurant was great.We ordered room service one night, took about 40 minutes and was of a decent standard.We tried hard to listen for construction noise throughout but could hear none. We ventured to the south side of the resort and did hear moderate construction noise. To avoid this being a problem within the suites try to avoid suite numbers starting in one (buildings 101-132). In our opinion, if you choose suite numbers starting in a 2 or a 3, you should have no problems.",

        "content": "Great People This was our second time in Punta Cana and we went specifically for the great beach. We were not disappointed. It is the only place that we have visited, that you can walk as far as yu want without hitting a barrier.HotelThe hotel was very clean and the rooms were great. The people everywhere were great. Our last trip to Punta Cana was about three years ago and one comment we had at that hotel was the staff either were new to their jobs or not happy with them. Someone in an earlier post mentioned about buying a converter for the electrical. The rooms are wired for 110 and there is a flat prong outlet on the inside of the recessed round outlets. I brought an extension cord and ran a US appliance daily with no problems. I am not sure if the other persons room was different, but we had no problems in using the electrical outlets with our US appliances. Outlets are few and far between, if you want something by hte bed, bring an extension cord.FoodThe food was good, however, out of the 8 different all inclusive resorts we have been at, this buffet was probably one of the least impressive. The food was good and there were a number of choices, but there really wasn't much variety. A number of other resorts that we have been at have theme nights, which would have given a little more variety to the buffet each night. Also, another thing I have seen is for the restaurant to post what the entrees will be that day for the buffet. It just gives you an opportunty to plan where you want to eat. This would help at lunch, since you can not go in the buffet with a swimming suit on even dry. I wasn't going to change out of my suit in the middle of the day just to see what was on the buffet.The bar by the beach at night was a nice quiet place to unwind from the day after dinner. Randy was a great bartender. Our safe did not work after check-in, so the manager sent out a repair guy immediately. The safe worked, but I found out there was a trick to make it work, then there was no problem.Also, the circuit breaker popped one night when my wife was using the hair dryer in the room. The repairman was there very shortly to reset.  GroundsThe grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. I don't remember seeing any trash ever on the grounds and the beach was always the cleanest.One suggestion for everyone, use your safe. We were walking on the beach by the Ocean Blue resort and found a plastic bag with $475, 5 credit cards, drivers license and room key. We made sure the owner got everything back, but it was not easy. Use the safe. I would go back to this hotel, except we always explore something new.",

Before we went I requested a high floor as near to the beach as possible, this request was granted. Our room was wonderful, always kept really clean and the fridge well stocked.As we were returning guests we were invited to the managers cocktail party, which just happened to be on our anniversary. It was really wonderful and we had a long chat with the Director Snr Colman. Also we met up with Alexis who arranged our daughter Louise's wedding 2 years ago. When she found out it was our anniversary that day she arranged a beautiful floral display and a bottle of champagne to be waiting for us in the steak restaurant where we had booked our meal for that night.We never had any problems getting reservations in the a la carte restaurants and the food was very good in all of them, also in the buffet restaurants.The beach is the best in the Dominican Republic and we have stayed in every Iberostar on the island. This is by far the best.The staff are really pleasant and work extremely hard to make your stay a happy one. We do not have one single complaint. The Star Friends never stop working and always have a smile on their faces day and nightWe are booked to go back in Septemebr of this year and cant wait to meet up with Alexis, Snr Colman and all the wonderful staff again.",

        "content": "Very Nice Resort We just returned from a wonderful week at the Iberostar Dominicana. After reading all of these reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect- I was pleasantly surprised that most of what people complained about seemed to be exagerated. Food- I could always find something to eat. If you are there for a week, the breakfast and lunch selections are repetitive, so try to not eat everything you see in the first few days. We made reservations for 2 nights. The Gourmet was the best. It was a 5 course meal with grilled lobster and amazing asparagus soup. The tropical restaraunt- The Marimba was also very good. We also went to the Rock Star Cafe two nights. The food is great and you don't have to make reservations. It is very small though, so I would recommend going right at 7.Room- Our room was fine. There was a slight musty smell, but there always is when you are in the tropics. The worst part of the room were the pillows. They were so flat, I am not sure why they even put them on the bed. Another thing to warn you about is the water in the bathroom- it smells. We had an old shower curtain that smelled horrible and had to ask the maid to bring another one. Pool and Beach- I was amazed at how many people laid on the beach. I have been traveling to Mexico for the last few years and everyone spends time at the pool- that is not the case here. We had an early riser in our group who saved chairs by the pool, but we wouldn't have had a problem getting chairs if we had slept in. The pool was very nice and was always being cleaned. The beach was very crowded with walkers from the other resorts. Lots of topless women that you probably would have rather not seen topless! Drinks- I was disappointed with the drinks. There was no consistency. Pina Colada's and Coco Loco's were frozen sometimes and on ice others- it was very frustrating because you never knew what you were going to get. Staff- The staff was always very nice to us. They speak little English so communication was not always easy but they would do everything they could to try to understand us. If you are planning on giving tips, you should bring small bills with you because there is not a place to get change. We did not leave the resort at all. We were very content with the kayaks, catamarans, beach and pool. We would definately come back to this resort again.",

They first served us juice, then a breakfast sandwich and drink, the another drink and a snack. I can't believe they still provide service like this on an airplane! You are given free headphones to watch a free movie. On the trip down they were showing Home Alone and The Grinch on the return trip. AIRPORT You get off the plane and walk to the terminal which is basically just a hut with no air conditioner. Once inside your photo is taken with two Dominican ladies. You can pick this photo for $7 when you come back to go home. You pay $10 for a tourist card which they collect 5 minutes later. Everyone tells you to get a receipt for the tourist card, but they do not give them. We didn't have any issues about having the card when we left like others had previously written. When we got there they get you in and out FAST! When leaving, it takes a little longer to get out. Half of the airport is air-conditioned and half is not, so it can get a little warm. But the breeze keeps everything somewhat cool. BEWARE! You can only buy alcohol to take home at the airport after going through the initial security when you are leaving. Make sure that you keep the receipt that the shop gives you or security will ta ke it before you leave. They check everyone at the gate and they asked for my receipt for the two bottles of liquor we'd bought. They were going to take it if I couldn't provide a receipt. RESORT/ROOMS The drive to the resort from the airport was approximately 40 minutes. The roads are very windy and bumpy. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a junior suite on the Bavaro side. We're not sure why.....Apple Vacations gives alot of upgrades or we've been to an Iberostar before. We stayed in building 3895. This was right by the beach. Our room was ok. The beds were really soft and we requested a king size bed, but received two double beds. We pushed them together and dealt with it. The room was kind of old. The air conditioner was leaking water all over the floor. We found a maid and asked for more towels to mop up the excess water (my husband gave her a couple dollars to help us). We never saw the maid again or our towels. We went into one of their storage rooms and found an old rug and some old towels to put on the floor to mop up the river of water. Our air conditioner quit working during th e last night, so it was rather warm. We were rationed to two bath towels, two hand towels, and two wash cloths each day. They fill the minibar with soda, water, and beer every other day. We left the maid one dollar with a note (in Spanish) asking for extra soda and she left it for us. In some of the previous postings, some people mentioned about getting bit by bugs. The only bug we saw was one roach that was on the floor of our room. We did not get any bites and I am usually the one that gets bit up. The resort is decorated with Christmas lights, Christmas trees, a nativity scene, and various other decorations for the season. Most of the trees have Christmas lights strung around them. BEACH Awesome! The sand is so soft. The water was pretty rough for the entire time we were there (red flags). At times the undertow was swift. It was fun to jump in the waves. I'm not sure if it is this rough all of the time or not. The water was cool, but after you got in it was fine. There are lots of palapas (umbrellas), but you must get down to the beach early to get one. There is a shopping area not too far down the beach. You must bargain with them or you will pay too much. My husband bought me a charm for my bracelet and the guy started the price at $60---and we ended up paying $15. If you have children, beware of the topless women. They are all over. It didn't bother my husband, but it might be awkward with children. POOL The pool was nice. It was a bit cool in temperature, but not too hard to get used to. The temperature was around 85 degrees every day and very nice at night. There's a juice bar between the Dominicana pool and the Punta Cana pool. They have really good smoothie drinks made with real fruit. The pools average depth is 5'9 which might require you to tippy toe around the pool in order to keep your head above water. Keep and eye on your children. FOOD The food was geared toward the Europeans. It was good, but not what we are used to. The buffet gets old pretty quick. We got one dinner reservation which we made for the Steak House. The only time they said that they had open was 9:30 pm. We made the reservations first thing when we got there. The reservation lady said to come back that day at 6:00 and she would call the restaurant and see if they could squeeze us in earlier. She got us in at 7:00. The food wasn't too bad, but nothing to rave about. You can wear shorts because this is an outside restaurant. The floor of the restaurant is sand so leave the dress shoes at home. The Star Rock Cafe was the best! This restaurant had steak, buffalo wings, hamburgers and much more. Each person gets an appetizer, main course, and a desert. This restaurant opens at 7:00 and you do not need to make a reservation. ;Shorts are ok too. The Sta r Rock Cafe has pool tables, tv's and a few video games. We did not get sick at all from the food. We stayed away from non-cooked foods and things that spoil after sitting out too long. I would bring Immodium and Pepto just to be safe. CASINO We went to the casino and played a little just for fun. We didn't win, but our money lasted for awhile. DRINKS We brought big cups from home. They are more than happy to fill these cups for you. The cups that they give you are kids size. We've learned this from other all-inclusive resorts. Not once while at the beach or the pool were we offered a drink. ENTERTAINMENT/STAFF The shows were entertaining. The staff was friendly and tried hard to please. We didn't have too much of a problem with the language. Most of the employees can speak enough to take care of your needs. SUMMARY I would definitely return to this resort and Punta Cana. The resort is beautiful and well maintained. This is our 2nd Iberostar that we've stayed at and we would recommend the chain to anyone. The service we've received at both has been excellent. The only thing I would say is that the water in Punta Cana is not quite the beautiful blue that it is in Cancun/Riviera Maya, Mexico. This resort is pretty much on the Atlantic Ocean not the Caribbean. They are building up the Dominican Republic and I think at some point it will be as built up as Cancun has become.",

        "content": "The good, the bad, and the ugly. I stayed at the Dominicana with my family 7/26-8/02. Overall, the resort had a very European flavor to it. The food was probably more comfortable for Europeans but I found enough to eat. I am not a big fan of Speedo bathing suits so had to put up with that all week, but that is the European way. My guess is that only 20% of the guests were from the US.The good: The facility is fabulous. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously kept. The staff is friendly and, when they understand english, helpful. The pools are beautiful and well maintained. The beaches are clean and expansive. The room was a good size and was well maintained by the staff throughout the stay. There was plenty to do for my kids. We spent about equal time at the beach and the pool. The ocean has more waves than I anticipated and so the kids enjoyed playing in the water. The food had some good and bad (see below for bad). There was tremendous variety and although a lot of the food was scary, there was enough for me to find to be happy with. My wife had a harder time finding food that she liked. The kids also had some trouble finding good food. However, food was always readily available. The best place for lunch was not the main food place at the beach, but farther down the beach at the evening steak house. They had a relaxed uncrowded atmosphere with good food for lunch. The scuba diving was good but not the usual 100 foot visibility I am used to in the Carribean (more like 40-60 feet depending on the day). The best dive was on the wreck clearly visible from shore. For airport transfers I contacted Silva Transportation directly and for 7 of us it was $75 each way in a private airconditioned van. They were waiting for us whan we got off the plane and no problem getting us to the airport on time for departure. The watersports were fun (and free) with high-quality well-maintained Hobie Cats and ocean kayaks.The bad:The food had some flaws. The fruit was disappointing. Generally not ripe and lacking in variety. They apparently don't have oranges in the DR, because the OJ was more like Tang. Not the fresh squeezed I was expecting (like Cancun). The food overall catered more to the Europeans than the Americans. The specialty restaurants were good but not great. Avoid the Hard Rock wanna-be. It was lousy. The open bar was nice but the quality of the drinks was so-so. Fortunately the local beer is decent, cause it's the only one you can get. The diving overall was good, but we were treated like dive students. They are overly cautious and make you stay right with a dive master. We actually had one dive master leading us and another behind us on one of the dives (can you say moo?) I was half expecting someone to come and adjust my BC during a dive. The beach is very European. I was surprised at the amount of toplessness. It wasn't limited to stationary sunbathers -- there were plenty of women walking the beaches with their tops off. If you have kids beware. I realize this is a cultural difference between Europe and America, but I am an American and it made me uncomfortable, especially having children there. The pool is supposed to be no topless but the rule was frequently broken. The internet is expensive -- $5 per 1/2 hour.The ugly: Half of our group came down with traveler's diarrhea despite the fact that we never left the resort.. You need to ask yourself if you are willing to take a chance on losing 1-2 days of your vacation by coming here. We spoke with other Americans and it was the same story with everyone -- half of the Americans came down with traveler's diarrhea. My understanding is that this problem is not limited to Iberostar, but is common throughout the resorts. The most distressing part is that traveler's diarrhea comes from an entero-toxic E. Coli bacteria that isn't supposed to be in food or water. It is a colon bacteria. Why I am I getting infected by a colon bacteria when I eat and drink the food at the resort? The answer is that there are some hygeine/cleanliness problems. For this reason alone I would not come back to the DR and would not suggest it to others.",

        "content": "Lovely resort, but I became sick and was hospitalized. OVERVIEW: We went to the Iberostart Dominicana Hotel Resort for four nights June 8-12, 2006. 鈥淲e鈥?were my husband, our two children (16 and 20) and myself. We thought the accommodations were lovely, the food okay but the whole vacation was marred by my getting so sick I was hospitalized. My husband got less sick and is still recovering now (it is Wednesday and we got back Monday night). My son only had a few stomach cramps and my daughter did not get sick at all. I say all this, because I don鈥檛 know why I got sick. The blood tests did not show anything so they assumed it was a virus. I think it had something to do with sanitation of the food or water. But I cannot be sure. ACCOMODATIONS: The hotel rooms were lovely and my two teenage kids said 鈥淕ood Job Mom鈥?upon arrival. The grounds were exquisite and I especially enjoyed watching the Flamingos. There was always a breeze at the ocean, so even on hot days we were comfortable sitting under a palapa reading and looking at the sea. It really was pretty. The rooms were spotless and very nice with a balcony. The marble-look bathroom was lovely. I was very pleased with the accommodations and the cleanliness.BEFORE: Before booking, I was very concerned about all the reports of sickness on Trip Advisor for this resort and several of the Dominican Republic resorts and almost didn鈥檛 book our vacation there. I was assured by our local Apple travel agent that they had sent hundreds of people to the D.R. and no one had gotten sick. I decided to go armed with food advice from a business associate who travels to the DR every month (he said he doesn鈥檛 eat any uncooked vegetables and only drinks bottled water) and a friend who recommended Pro-Biotics to ward off the intestinal blues (I checked with my Doctor who thought that was a good idea). I also brought Immodium and Pepto Bismal, recommended on Trip Advisor (a necessity...and bring it with you on the plane home. I saved a couple of people by having it on my carryon on the plane home). So I thought I was totally prepared to ward off any symptoms that would mar our vacation.We also brought a lot of 30 SPF and 50 SPF sunscreen. I also brought insulated mugs. I was the only one who really used one. I brought hats. We packed bug repellent, but didn鈥檛 need it. My son got a mosquito bite the first night and he wished I had hydrocortisone, but I never saw or felt any bugs. I was a good boy scout!PHOTO ID: Just to let you know if you have someone 16 (and I think anyone under 18), we only needed the embossed birth certificate. We did not need a photo ID for her to get into and out of the DR. Please note that starting Dec. 2006, ALL people of all ages will need a passport for ALL countries.OUR STAY: THE LONG VERSION:We arrived late afternoon on Thursday and found some food at the beach caf茅, which was very welcome since we hadn鈥檛 had lunch. Right away there was a problem getting bottled water. The bar did not offer it.Later we ate dinner at the buffet. I thought it was mediocre, but my husband liked it. I am not a big fan of buffets because I tend to eat a lot of everything and don鈥檛 feel satisfied. I was dismayed to find out we only qualified for one guaranteed a la carte restaurant meal since we were staying only 4 nights. After friendly questioning, I found out if you come back the morning of the day you want to get an additional reservation, they will book it for you if there is availability. We used our guaranteed reservation for the Steak House since that is what got the most rave reviews on Trip Advisor (I never ate there, but my family said the steaks were good and the rest mediocre). Friday morning we got a reservation at the Oriental Restaurant (the entr茅e was so overcooked, it was inedible. The sushi was good.).Friday morning we ate the buffet breakfast (one side is more American and one side European, though I don鈥檛 know which was which). I enjoyed the omelet made for me and we all loved the pancakes. There was always fresh fruit and lots of breads and jams and cereals. Breakfast was our favorite meal there. I will say from the very start I felt a panic on what was safe to eat and what wasn鈥檛. The restaurant didn鈥檛 have bottled water and that threw me for a loop. And the water had that sulphur taste of how the water used to taste near the beaches of the US. Didn鈥檛 mean it was bad, but made me feel uneasy. I checked with some other English speaking guests and they said they were told that all the ice and washing of food and drinking water was purified. I knew not to drink the tap water.There were bottles of water in the refrigerator but it looked like homemade labels and some of the bottles didn鈥檛 have labels at all. That did not breed my confidence. I checked, and all the caps were sealed. There was a gallon of water beside the refrigerator that had an expiration date on it and that made me feel more secure. All of this water tasted fine. I ended up feeling more secure about the gallon of water.At the buffet and the restaurants I waffled between going ahead and eating what I wanted and trying to avoid uncooked vegetables. There was a very good Gazpacho soup and I put cut up tomatoes in it. (was that what made me sick?) I ended up feeling uneasy about a lot of the choices because I just didn鈥檛 know what to avoid and what was fine. My husband ate it all, lettuce and everything. I preferred the taste of the bottled water in my room, so I brought that to the restaurant. This uneasiness was very uncomfortable to me. I saw other guests eating everything, but I had read so many reports on TripAdvisor of people getting sick, I just didn鈥檛 know what to avoid. I wished with all my heart I had brought my own bottled water so that I would know there was something completely safe to drink. Unfortunately, my uneasiness turned out to be valid.My husband and I both enjoyed the snorkeling in front of the Bavaro portion of the Iberostar resorts (facing the ocean go to the next swimming area to the right, past the couple of resort boats). We think the fish were almost like pets. Schools of blue tang followed us and swam under and around us. There were quite a few other tropical fish. The coral was mostly dead from hurricanes, but we did see some live coral and a few sea anemones underneath. We brought our own snorkeling equipment. There are at least two swimming areas roped off. At first we didn鈥檛 like that concept since we like to get to the reef, but after we were out there and the boats zoomed by only about 20 feet away from us, I felt safer knowing that I didn鈥檛 have to lift my head and wave every time a boat was near to show them I was there.My son paid for a windsurfing lesson ($39). He said it was very difficult. Not just because the balancing is so difficult, but because there were enough boats that kept going by he couldn鈥檛 really practice easily (both because of the boats and the waves, I think). He went to the disco a couple of times, but he said they were mostly older folks (30鈥檚 and 40鈥檚 and maybe even some 50鈥檚鈥?horrors!) and didn鈥檛 like it too well. He did do a beer drinking contest. One of the entertainment staff seemed to like him and that made him happy. Overall he really liked this resort. 鈥淏eautiful and the people were nice,鈥?he says.I felt completely safe with the kids going off by themselves. Usually they went together, but I also felt safe that my 16 year old daughter was by herself. The resort felt completely safe.My daughter got a massage and a facial and enjoyed it very much (about $75).My husband found a palapa easily every day any time of day. We found if you went to the right (facing the ocean) there were always vacant palapas. It was beautiful reading and looking at the ocean.ILLNESS:I wanted to explain to you the positives before I told you about the sickness. Friday afternoon I felt a little bit nauseous. In the middle of the night I ended up getting sick, both vomiting and diarrhea. I dragged the cushions from the little couch to the floor outside the bathroom so I could just crawl in. After a couple of hours I realized I was getting weak and probably dehydrated so I told my husband I needed to go see the doctor (I figured I needed a suppository since I couldn鈥檛 keep anything down) and that I needed a wheel chair because I couldn鈥檛 walk there. (the night before when we were walking around the little shops area, we noticed there was a 24 hour doctor clinic on site). Doug called the front desk and a golf cart came to the building and whisked us to the doctor.The doctor was a lovely well spoken woman. She explained I was dehydrated and needed IV and medicine to stop the nausea. She recommended I go to the hospital to get blood tests to determine exactly what was causing the problem so I could get the right medicine. She recommended we go by ambulance so that I could keep the IV going and in case I got sick again because of the jostling in the vehicle. She also told us that her consultation was not included in the resort and was $110. The ambulance was $170.She was clear to ask us if it was our choice for me to go to the hospital. We decided to go to the hospital to get the blood tests. We went by ambulance (although I thought he shut off the IV while the vehicle was moving and put it back on when we arrived. Go figure.)THE HOSPITAL:When we got to the hospital, the doctor there immediately told us he recommended I stay for 24 hours. I was surprised that he said that before any tests were completed. He explained that he thought I needed 24 hours of treatment to get the fluids back in and for any medicines to have a full treatment round via IV before I started the oral treatment. Doug found out the cost for a hospital stay would be around $1000 plus medicines for a day. (It ended up being $1070).We said we wanted to wait until we got the test results before we made our decision. Finally we agreed to have me admitted.They took me to a room that had a sweetness to it. It was a very comfortable bed with a blue and white patterned cotton bedspread. There was a small fabric couch and a recliner chair (maybe not so sanitary). It ended up I was very glad to be there because I had gotten very scared of all the food and drink at the hotel to the point I didn鈥檛 know what was safe. At the hospital I felt safe and I slept and slept and slept. I told my family they didn鈥檛 need to visit me (it was a $20 cab ride each way). The best thing they could do is thoroughly enjoy their vacation and call me once or twice. I thought it cool that there was a balcony there. After a day, I liked to go out there (my IV still in the room) to get a bit of fresh air. I wish all hospital rooms had a balcony.I watched carefully to see that they opened all the syringes fresh. I noticed a bit less than carefulness about their disposing of my used equipment. One time a part of the IV became unattached and there was some of my blood around it. The young nurse screwed it back together with her bare hands (a big risk for her and something you would never see in the States). All the nurses were very nice and young and didn鈥檛 speak any English. (I had been told that the Dominican Republic people are very lovely to look at and this gave me the opportunity to see a few of them. They had lovely bone structure and were very sweet.) A doctor came by three times with a translator. The doctor explained that the blood tests could not find anything. They figured it was a virus. When I asked if it could have been the water or food they said absolutely the hotel had to be using purified water or the whole hotel would have been there. Good point. But I am still not convinced that it wasn鈥檛 due to a slip of sanitation.Although I was mentally prepared for a 24 hour stay (9:30 am), I was dismayed when they kept me til 1 pm. But checkout was fast and easy.So, although I hope that no one else has to have this experience, if you do, you can know a bit of what to expect.My husband just came in while I am writing this and told me to add that he got the distinct impression if we had gotten travel insurance, we wouldn鈥檛 have had to pay anything there. Without it we had to pay up front and will need to ask our health insurance company to reimburse us here.Also note that he charged the Doctor鈥檚 visit and when he went to use the same charge card for the hospital bill the next day, it was refused. Turned out they refused it because he was in another country. Fortunately he had another card he could use. The credit card company told him he should always notify them before he goes to another country.By the way, I asked the hotel if they keep any records on who gets sick and who gets hospitalized. There was no interest or concern that I was sick nor records kept. My husband thought that it could be very useful for the hotel to note who was sick so that they could especially sanitize the room.As an interesting side point, on our shuttle from the hotel back to the airport, there was an American doctor and nurse also on the shuttle. He said it probably was a virus since I recovered so quickly. He mentioned that at the beach bar at the resort he was staying in (he was at a different one), when the bartender ran out of glasses, instead of getting more glasses that had gone through a dishwasher, he rinsed the used glasses out with tap water and reused them (note that the tap water is definitely not drinkable). He said it could have been something as simple as that and the reason I got so sick but my family didn鈥檛. MY OPINION: The way I figure it, the Dominican Republic is a lot like Mexico was 30 years ago when a lot of folks traveling there got 鈥淢ontezuma鈥檚 Revenge鈥? Over the years Mexico has solved the sanitation and water problem so that we can eat anything there (at least in the resorts) and not get sick. (By the way, I never got sick on any of my travels to Mexico even 30 years ago鈥?and I ate everything. We have also had no problems in Belize or the Cayman Islands as well as Western and Eastern Europe.). A part of me really liked the DR, the people are sweet and the resort was lovely. But I don鈥檛 know what I could do to feel okay about the food and drink. I think I would have to wait until the Trip Advisor reports weren鈥檛 mentioning so many sick visitors. (and next time I鈥檒l spend the extra money and stay at an island that doesn鈥檛 have these reports AND get travel insurance). By the way, my husband disagrees. He thinks we could have gotten sick anywhere. Hard to know. It is strange, but even though I got sick and was in the hospital, it was a sweet place and the hospital experience allowed me to meet more local people.I hope that this review helps and that wherever you go you have a wonderful and healthy time.I welcome any questions if you would like to email me.",

        "content": "Good Things To Know My wife and 12 year old son just returned from the Iberostar Dominicana which shares grounds, bars, and restaurants with Iberostar's Punta Cana and Bavaro. Here are a few thoughts/experiences.While admitedly the bus trip from the airport had us wide eyed doubting our decision to go the the D.R., that section of road is an uncharacteristic view of the rest of the D.R..It took a while for us to unwind from the whirl of travel and the rush of our lives and settle into vacation mode. The lobby is welcoming tropical beacon. The landscaping in a word...gorgeous. The soft beach sand encourages long walks. All staff was friendly and usually multi-lingual. I loved practicing my Spanish, but English only is just fine.A rough guess of visitors prime language: 30% English, 20% French, 20% German, 20% Spanish.You could be as busy as you wanted or as relaxed. We had no problems getting pool side loungers or a beach pallapa. In addition to a large choice of optional non-stop organized activies, there was the; natural beauty, pool, ocean, food, and drinks. Each evening had different shows, bands, contests, and dancing. The talent was truely amazing. We especially liked the Grammy's and Broadway shows. The 2 night clubs go to 3am.We brought snorkle gear and snorkled to small reefs right off the beach, though extra cost day trips were far better for that. The waves at Punta Cana were not made for surfing or boogie boarding though other areas of the D.R. are different and known for that. Windsurfing and Hobie Cat sailing was great. Do sign up for tennis court time early each morning or be disappointed!On Punta Cana Beach the trade winds blow a steady 20 mph but pool side breezes were lighter. There were no mosquitos, or no-see-ums. Make sure to use sun screen or you will be sorry. That sun is hot. The ocean was about 72 degrees the pools about 78.Yes, the buffet food wasn't great. Not bad, but not great. The diversity of choices more than made up it. The seasoning were Carribean and different which is why I like traveling to foreign countries. The theme restauants were actually quite good by the way. Theme restauants request long pants and collared shirts for men. I saw no suit coats. Elsewhere else was strickly T-shirts, shorts, and swimwear.We drank only bottled water (the water at the restaurants is out of the tap)and had lots of iced drinks. We did not get ill.We took two day trips; The Marinaria and Bavaro Runners. Both were fun. The Runners trip showed the real side of the D.R. we had come to see. The road from the airport is not representative of the D.R. at all. If you do Bavaro runners - seriously - be sure to bring enough cash for souveigners; photo ops, coffee, cocoa, real cigars, massages, rum, jewelry, even a DVD about the D.R. with you in it. Yes, the rooms were simply O.K. but who spends that much time in their room? We visited other nearby resorts which were much more posh. At one I almost wished I had a neck tie - no thanks. Most others we visited made us glad we were where we were. The Dominicana was very comfortable. On an overall scale the resort was like a Raddison.Remember this is not America; which is why we went. Bring your sense of adventure. Have a Santa Libre or a Miami Vice at the bar. Get out...explore and by all means try to pack light.",

        "content": "Great vacation! Just returned from a week at this resort (Feb 4-11). There were 6 in our group and we all had a great time. We went through Apple Vacations, which we have used before, and there were no problems here.Upon arriving at the airport, we got our $10 tourist cards, which were then taken from us after being stamped. We thought we needed them to leave, but apparently not. Do make sure when you leave that you get immigration forms from either your Apple rep or at the airport when you check in.Got our luggage and found the Apple people; they directed us to our transfer bus. Beware of the porters trying to act like they work for Apple; they are just looking to take your luggage to the bus and then want a tip. It鈥檚 not that far to the bus, so if you can manage your luggage by yourself, do it. About 陆 hour ride to the resort. The room was very spacious and was always very clean. Air conditioning worked very well (almost too well for me, but hubby likes the room very cold!) You will more than likely need the outlet adapter; but as others have stated, they sell them in the store by the lobby. Also, there are no clocks in the rooms.Headed to the buffet for the first night and found lots of good things to eat. We ended up only having dinner at the buffet on 3 of the nights. We ate the other nights at the Steakhouse, Mexican, Tropical, and Star Rock Caf茅. They were all very good. Reservations are required for all but the Star Rock. Star Rock has open seating from 7-9 PM. And contrary to what you might read, of these 4 restaurants, long pants for the men are only required for the Mexican restaurant. Now that doesn鈥檛 mean you can wear your swim trunks and $@!#% flops to the others; should wear nice 鈥淏ermuda鈥?type shorts to the Steakhouse and Tropical. More casual clothes (i.e., jean shorts) are fine for the Star Rock. The Steakhouse, Mexican, and Tropical all have small buffets for the appetizers; thought the Mexican was the best on this.As for breakfast and lunch, the buffets are what they are 鈥?buffets. If you鈥檙e expecting 5-star cuisine, you鈥檒l be disappointed. Thought the breakfast buffet was very good 鈥?you can get eggs and omelettes made to order; loved the pancakes and the sugar donuts. Tip on the pancakes 鈥?they only make them on one side; a plate gets made up and carried to the other buffet. So if you want the freshest ones, get them from the side where you can see the guy actually making them. Yes it is basically the same thing every day, but how much different can you get with breakfast? There鈥檚 all the basic breakfast stuff, and some things that Americans don鈥檛 think of as breakfast foods, but apparently are normal for Europeans.The lunch buffet down by the beach was pretty good; I usually had pasta and fish or chicken of some kind (and fries and nachos!). And they cook up something on the big grill outside; paella a couple of the days, brats and burgers another day. It maybe got a little repetitious, but we never went hungry. Our big limitation on the buffets is that we don鈥檛 eat any of the salad or fruit 鈥?just think this is why a lot of people get sick. Ice cream stand next to the beach buffet was very good.Beach was very beautiful and we never had any problems finding beach chairs or a palapa. But, we are also early risers and were usually settled in by 9:30 or so. Sort of a 鈥渟hortcut鈥?to get to the beach: exit the building from the opposite side from the pool/elevators. There is a nice straight walkway all the way to the beach. If you exit the other way, the walkway kind of meanders through the grounds, you have to go around the pool, and through the tables outside the buffet.Also, grounds are very nice and well maintained. There are a few flamingos and peacocks, and most days we saw George the rooster strutting his stuff.As for the Europeans vs. Americans thing 鈥?yes it is predominantly Europeans, but we never had a problem with rude Europeans as some people have talked about in other reviews. If anything, it was the Americans we had a problem with. We encountered several cases of Americans on the beach who felt the need to talk non-stop and did not seem to have any volume control. It鈥檚 no wonder Americans get a reputation of being loud and obnoxious. This seemed to be more of a problem when we were on the Punta Cana side of the beach one day.Service by the bartenders and bar waitresses was good. We do tip these people, so that might be part of the reason for the good service. We found other staff to be very friendly. Would like to have had a better selection of liquor; Iberostars in Mexico seemed to do better in this area. But, the El Presidente (draft) was always cold and my husband enjoyed the Bohemia beer (bottled). Seemed to only be able to get the Bohemia in the minibar in your room or at the lobby bar.We did the Marinarium snorkel excursion and that was a lot of fun. The nurse sharks were very cool (and very large!!). Saw some interesting fish and the coral was OK, but we have gotten spoiled in that we don鈥檛 usually snorkel with large groups of people, so that was the only downside.All in all, it was a great vacation and a much needed break from the Ohio winter!",

        "content": "Great resort, with one exception I just returned from a stay at the Iberostar Dominican with my husband and we had an excellent time, despite a medical emergency we experienced while there. I will reiterate the positive comments previously posted about the hotel: great pool, excellent beach, clean rooms, great service. The food was good and presented us with no health problems. The one warning I have about the hotel is about the 24 hour medical clinic. My husband had a little accident while on an excursion and it was obvious that his collar bone was broken. Other American travellers advised us not to go to the local hospital. The medical staff at the resort clinic was of absolutely no help at all. They could not supply us with a sling or pain killers of any kind. It was obvious they had little medical training and did not care about my husband's welfare. Shortly after the accident occured, my husband passed out in our room and was unconscious for close to a minute. I called the medical clinic for help but by the time they arrived he was awake and back in bed. I was told that I should not have bothered them. We had to wait 2 days to fly back to the States because the number of flights out of Punta Cana are limited. At the hospital back here in the US, we found that he had a broken collar bone, 6 broken ribs and a concussion.I hope this information can act as a word of caution to anyone who may have medical problems or to those who are accident prone. The resort is excellent, but not equipped for an emergency.",

        "content": "would recommend but wouldn't go back I travelled with my husband 43 daughter 20 and son 16, 15 - 29 August. We travelled with Direct holidays from Gatwick, the flight was horrendous. Left Gatwick at 11 am after 30 minute delay and then touched down in Manchester to pick up passengers and were delayed here another 2 hrs 45 minutes. Eventually arrived at the resort 9 pm Dom Rep time. We were very annoyed because we were told by Direct Holidays that we couldn't board in Manchester because there was no availability even though we booked in September 2004, then we had to off load at manchester due to a shortage of flight crew and had to re board, so why couldn't we have just got on at manchester in the first place? beyond me! We landed at La Romana airport but would advise against this as it was a 2 hour drive to the hotel, fly to Punta Cana, I would even pay a bit more for my holiday if I had the choice. We were advised to take malaria tablets due to 4 cases reported from this area by English tourists who are now suffering. This is since the 2004 hurricane.When we arrived at the hotel it was one of the best sites I have ever seen. It usually takes me a few days to relax and get into it, but the stress was taken away instantly and I new I had arrived in paradise. Check in was quick and smooth with our cases brought to the room within minutes of walking through the door. The rooms are a bit dated but large, immaculately clean, comfortable beds, lounge area with TV, well stocked mini bar and plenty of bottled water, which is not tampered with as some people have stated. There is also an electronic safe which is big enough to put a video camera in as well as all other valuables. The bottle opener is on the wall in the bathroom. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom and also shampoo and body wash dispensers on the wall next to the shower. We were in rooms 3242 and 3244 with a view of carribean street, not brilliant but very quiet. Just leave the maid a note to let her know what drinks you want re stocking in the mini bar, we did leave her tips now and then but she would have done so without. The main reason we left her tips was because she looked after our daughter one day when she had to stay in doors due to sickness and diarhoea - and thats another story. We all suffered with it through out the 2 weeks we were there. It did spoil the holiday some what as we had to make sure that we were always close to the toilet. After a visit to the pharmacy it was confirmed that we were all suffering from food poisoning along with the rest of the holiday makers we spoke to. When you consider the hygene standards of certain nationalities then it's not surprising food poisoning is so common, i was following other women out of the toilet who weren't washing their hands and then going over to the the self service drinks area and touching glasses, I was astonished and sickened.The grounds are beautiful, gardens with ponds, flamingos, peacocks, ducks and a big fat cockerel that likes to watch the entertainment (well thats what they call it) in the evening. There are 2 swimming pools, one for each hotel building. The Punta Cana and Dominicana are identical buildings stood opposite each other with all bars and restaurants shared between the 2. The Punta Cana is quieter with its own lobby bar and a small band playing in the evening where you can have a dance if you wish. The local music is bachata which to be quite honest I found a bit boring, I was looking forward to some salsa but apart from day time lessons it was never to be heard in the evening. The bars are plentyfull around the resort and the food is literally 24 hours. The evening entertainment was not up to much, people were comparing it to Butlins but to be honest I wouldn't insult Butlins. The star friends do work very hard organising games in the day time and putting on the shows at night, I could name a few of them but not all as the entertainment team do not form part of our holiday enjoyment. The kdis did go to the disco a few times but not as often as they normally would due to sickness and diarhoea attacking intermitently. The only other complaint I have is that the beach bar shut at 11 pm, my husband and I thought this was the most relaxing place to sit and have a chat and just watch the sand crabs at play, it was blissful. Now for the beach, WOW, it is awesome, white powder sands, clear turqoise sea and seaweed cleared every morning, but does build up again later in the day. Because of designated swimming areas the sea did get crowded and this created sand churning so the sea was not so clear for the rest of the day. I was up and on the beach every day by 7.30 am and if you werent out there by 9 then you would have no chance of a sun bed as they would all be reserved by this time. To say that this is damned annoying is an uderstatment and the worst culprits were the Americans who I found out are not only greedy with food but everything else, they would reserve sunbeds for each body in the shade and the same amount of beds in the sun, then walk away and come back 3 hours later, I dont see any reason why the rule of no reserving can not be enforced, there is enough staff around the place. The same problem happened at the 2 pools also but we only layed around the pool on 2 days as we much prefer the beach. Topless bathing is allowed on the beach but not by the pool. It's does state in the brochure that all none motorised sports are included, what it doesn't say is that you have to first pay $40 for a briefing lesson prior to taking out the kayaks and wind surf boards. It also states that pool is included in the all inclusive, but again there was a charge of $1 a game.The staff are really friendly, from the grounds staff to the hotel manager. Every one speaks English contrary to what the travel brochures state. I did speak in Spanish when ever possible and this was appreciated and corrected where necessary with a smile.The food - 2 buffet restraunts for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight snacks. 2 buffet restaurants next to the beach, one at each hotel which served food from 10 am until 5 pm and the choice of food was enormous, I would defy any one to be picky at this hotel. Fish was in abundance so, if like me you love any kind of fish then you will be in fish heaven, from sardines to salmon and lobster. We even had champagne for breakfast as this is inlcuded also. Cocktails that would put Tom Cruisie to shame, my daughter and I did justice to the strawberry daquiries as our afternoon tipple and then followed with a fitful sleep on the beach! We also visited some of the a la cart restaurants, make sure you book all a la carts at the start of your holdiay as they get booked up pretty quick. 4 days before we were coming home I wanted to book the gourmet but it was full up every evening. The oriental (not up to much), the steak (excellent) nothing was too much trouble for these guys, the tropical we visited on our daughters 20th birthday and I whispered to the head waiter that it was her birthday and could the staff please sing happy birthday to her, they did more than that, at the end of our meal they turned out all the lights and carried out a huge cake with 4 candles on it and all the staff and guests sang happy birthday, the cake was too big for us to eat it all so my daughter told the staff to share it after they had finished work, we left a good tip to be shared among all the staff and this was appreciated not expected. And the food was excellent. Didn't try the gormet or mexican but did hear they were also excellent. Dress code is not strictly enforced in the a la cart's which i found dissapointing, I dont want to sit in my finery while the guy on the next table is wearing jeans/shorts and a t shirt. They were strict in the buffet restaurants, turfing out any body wearing beach shorts and sleeveless t shirts at dinner. We also ate one night in the Rock Star cafe, OK but didn't go back even though reservations aren't required.Wine - which was good, beer and soft drinks are served at lunch and dinner in the buffet restraunts and champagne at breakfast. The food in the buffets was very good with lots of choice for every one. Do go steady with the salads as the pharmacist warned this is where the food poisoning could be lurking, so be warned. The coffee was excellent quality as were the cheeses and deserts. If you smoke there is a smoking section in all restaurants.We did 2 trips which we felt were very expensive but enjoyable. The jeep safari costing 拢70 each was informative of Dom Rep life and a swim on Macau beach at the end was most welcome. My husband and son swam with sharks which they felt was a bit of a rip off as they only actually spent 1 hour in the water and at 拢50 for an afternoon was pretty steep. My daughter and I spent a blissful afternoon in the spa being pampered and as high class hotels go the treatments weren't that expensive.If you want to shop i recommend you steer clear of the hotel shop as it is ver, very expensive. My husband did buy some hand rolled cigars from the hotel cigar shop and the quality was excellent. Further up the beach past the Bavaro are some shacks selling almost anything and this is where we did our souvenier shopping, be prepaired to haggle, we ended up paying a quarter of the asking price.There is also a casino which made a pleasant alternative some evenings as overall we came out $140 dollars up. We didn't play the tables only the machines and won jackpot 3 times on different machines. Drinks are also included in the casino.We had a fantastic family holiday and probably our last together as the kids are wanting to do their own thing next year, so we had a great holiday to remember for ever. Would I go back, the answere has to be no because of the food poisoning but we will definitley be going back to the carribean, probably Barbados.Don't hesitate to email me if you wish to know anything that I may have forgotten to report.",

        "content": "Great Place for all! My family and I just returned from a two-week holiday at the Iberostar Punta Cana. I flew out of JFK on a non-stop American Airlines flight. It was great! The plane was not crowded. I traveled with my husband and two children ages 2.4 and 1.1 years. Both children did not get much sleep the night before. They both fell asleep about one hour into the flight. Lucky me! The plane arrived half hour early at 11:00 a.m. Once you exit the plane the hot and humid air hits you right in the face! It was a smooth exit from the airport. I was one step ahead of the game because I purchased my tourist cards at the consulate in New York and had them already filled out. I headed straight for Customs. My bags came right away. I did not have ground transportation to and from the airport. I was told you can grab a cab as soon as you exit. The advice was correct.I had an air-conditioned van for $24 USD. The ride to the hotel was a little scary. However, I wasn鈥檛 surprised because the roads are similar to my grandparents city of Coamo, Puerto Rico. Going towards the hotels in PC there are two lanes. One going and the other coming. If you want to pass the very slow moving vehicle in front you would have to go into the oncoming traffic lane to pass the vehicle. This is scary. However the Dominicans are used to driving like this so I wasn鈥檛 concerned. I was also not surprised on how some of the poor people live. The housing is called shanty-towns 鈥淢ake Shift Homes鈥? I am familiar with this because I traveled to RIO and the poor people live like the same. Well to get off the subject and on to the hotel.Of course there was only one person at the reception and his last name happened to be RUIZ which is my mothers last name. He spoke English but I spoke in Spanish. I gave the guy $30 to upgrade me to a Junior Suite. I could have given him less because he didn鈥檛 even ask for money. The Junior Suite was nice but it was not conveniently located. The Junior Suites are located near the front entrance of the property. The front entrances is close to the buffet and Japanese restaurants. The suites have double or king size bed with a small table and chair a sofa and a very nice bathroom with a big tub. The downside of this location is that it is a far walk to the pool and beach. Not a big deal if I was married with no kids. But shelping beach stuff with two kids in toe is difficult. The same day I went to the front desk and ask to speak with the manager. The manager鈥檚 name is Mr. Coleman. He is a very nice gentleman and has a way with words! I guess that is why he manage鈥檚 all three hotels Punta Cana, Dominicana, and Bavaro. I asked if there was anyway he can get me a standard room closer to the beach. He pleasantly advised to come and see him the next day around 2:00 p.m. and he will see what he can do. Well patience paid off because he gave us a family suite! The family suite was located on the second floor hop skip and jump from the pool area.The suite was two rooms. The first had a king size bed, sofa bed, TV and bathroom. The other connecting room had two double beds w/ a TV. Both rooms had a patio with table and two chairs. It was really nice. I also asked for a crib it was clean and it served the purpose. The decore is a little outdated but the rooms serve the purpose. Pool  Beach  FoodThere are two pools side by side one for Dominicana and the other for Punta Cana. They were a good size but would have like a bigger pool. But then again who goes to the carribean to sit in a pool. The sun is strong to the pool water gets warm. There is a lot of space for kids to place. There is also a baby pool. The pools are kept very clean. The first week of arrival was not crowded so I did not need to reserve a sun shade. As the week past I found I had to wake up in the morning for the prime spot. Only because I had kids. The beach is absolutely beautiful. This is where I spent my entire vacation. I set up shop on the first row of huts. So I was two steps from the pools and two steps from the beach and right between the beach buffets! The front of the Dominicana pool is the activity side. They have lots of games provided by the wonderful star friends. I danced Merengue and my 2 year old sun did too! The ice cream at the La Cana is way better than the La Yola Icecream Stand. The La Cana has rotisseree chicken that is great better than the other buffet. BUT the buffet near the dominicana has frenchfries with cheese, rice and beans, etc. More of a selection.Food and RestaurantsI was pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty decent. I mean come on you are in the Dominican Republic not NYC! The buffet is an open air restaurant so you will see flies. Some people freak out. They are not swarming all over the food. They basically annoy you at the tables. I have a great tip. Take a napkin and place it over your food while you are eating. Leave a small opening. No flies will come. It worked. I did this the entire week. People must have thought I was crazy. I had low expectations of the food and brought every medication in gods creation. I only got sick once for a 陆 day took Ammodium AD pills and walla it was gone! At the buffet they have steaks made to order. Rice, Vegees, Pork, pasta, pizza, etc. I stayed away from the salads but I found everything was temperature controlled. I found them checking the temperature of the cold foods often, which is a good thing. The were constantly cleaning up. First couple of days I tipped the waiters for getting me water and soda but it was easier just to get it myself so I stopped tipping after the first week. Another tip is to make sure you eat your food well done. The pork shoulder is cook well. But the little cuts of meat (steak) is not cooked well. They just brown the meat to meet the demand of people. Just ask the cook to cook it more well done and you won鈥檛 get sick. This is why I had to take Ammmodium AD because I ate a raw piece of steak.A lot of people get sick because they drink too many of those frozen drinks. The frozen drinks are very sweet. Especially the coconut ones; these are pure laxatives! Hey if you drink in the sun and eat a lot you will get sick! I met a couple from PA and he was drinking lots of RUM. I said to him that you better slow down buddy you will get sick. He said nahh! I drink all the time and sure enough he was in the room the entire day sick as a dog with diareara. Lucy鈥檚 ClubThis club is for children 4-12? The club was small but they do have lot鈥檚 of games, movies and various indoor/outdoor activities. There is a staff of two. During the crowded point of my stay I saw about 12 children walking from one activity to another. There was one girl in the front and one in the back making sure everyone played follow the leader. The girls understand English quite well but speak a little English. They did a great job at the Mini Disco which is held nightly. It鈥檚 repetitous but that鈥檚 because they want the kids to follow them. They march, dance and do play skits. It鈥檚 really cute. My son loved the mini disco even though he was only 2.4. He danced around the stage by himself at times! and tuckered himself out that when we went back to the room he fell asleep really fast. IT was wonderful! The girls work really hard because again this is not there end of the day. They start at 10am and work until 10 pm. That鈥檚 a long day. Make sure you tip them. One of the girls lived in Santo Domingo and goes home every 11 days!I would recommend this resort for everyone. It鈥檚 a great chain. If you like to party stay on the Domincana side. If you like peace and quite stay on the Punta Cana. Remember the Dominicana side has everything from the shows, casino, etc. RUDE PeopleBefore departure I read numerous posts about people being rude (ie. Americans and Europeans). I always have an open mind when I am on vacation because who wants to argue? Well that statement was short lived. I guess because I was one week and five days into my vacation and the buffet was getting to me. I was standing in front of a dish that had ONE hot dog left. I had a plate in my hand with three hot dog buns (mind you my son was hungry). A gentlemen was using the thongs to pick up a piece of steak. I was waiting for those thongs because I have proper etiquette. Well long behold this French guy behind me (who see that I am waiting for the thongs with three buns in tow!) reaches over me and grabs the hot dog with his fingers!!!! I couldn鈥檛 believe it! That really ---- me off. I told him nicely that I was waiting for the thongs to get the hot dog and he pretended that he didn鈥檛 speak English. Well since he did that my husband went up to him and told him he was an ----. I knew he understood because a few minutes later he was sitting one table away speaking English to his friends. Go figure. The buffet at Lunch is like going to a High School Cafeteria. Everyone for themselves. Well that was my experience at the Buffet.",

        "content": "The food was really bad, but... We have stayed at the Iberostar in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, for the past three years and loved it. This spring we decided to try the Dominican Republic for a change. The weather and beaches were excellent. The resort itself was not up to the same standars as the Quetzal, in Mexico. I don't think the Dominicana should be considered a 5 star. The rooms were smaller, not as clean, and in need of minor repair. For example, the shower was really not operational. We complained, but no action was taken. The air didn't work very well either. The room had some peeling paint, and cracks in the tub and bathroom floor. Our biggest disappointment was the food. It was just awful. We are not picky, and can eat just about anything. I don't plan vacations around eating, but this was really bad. They were always running out of everything too, from ice to silverware to cups to fries. There were not enough staff, and the tables were dirty. We found none of these problems when we stayed in Mexico. Another thing was the staff was not nearly as friendly or helpful as in Mexico. Actually they were somewhat rude!! We found many more European tourists in the D.R., and a lot more topless!! All in all, it was okay, but I would much prefer to go to Mexico, and stay at the Iberostar Quetzal!",

        "content": "Amazing!! I went to the Riu Bambu with a friend and had the time of my life. I read alot of these reviews before going and certainly went trying to keep an open mind. I am not a world traveler by any means BUT that does not mean that I do not know a good thing when I see it. I was greeted at the resort with a cocktail, they brought my bags directly to the room and checkin was a breeze!The rooms were beautiful and very clean. The booze in the room was a great extra. I must also add that my friend called the day before we arrived and requested that our rooms be as close as possible and close to the beach. They gave us rooms across the hall from one another and the closest building to the beach!One night I heard some sort of alarm going off from another room and when I called to inquire, someone was at my door minutes after hanging up.Unlike others on here, I thoroughly enjoyed the the nightly entertainment. I watched the entertainment team rehearse each afternoon and then made sure I went to each show in the evening. I found it a great way to end my day. From 'Sexy Belly' to ' Baby Face' to Evelyn, they were all amazing.As for the food, I never had any stomach issues and ate at all of the restaurants. The selection was wonderful and very tasty. I think those that do complain may have set their expectations too high or are just picky!The resort itself was very clean, service top notch and never felt as though they treated one nationality better than the rest. I found that if you were polite to them, they were the same back. Never noticed anything different from Canadians to Americans...etc. The beach was amazing and always tidy. The pool was the same and always some games happening somewhere.I am very much looking forward to going back and having another week of fun. I was thrilled at how nice the resort was and how nice the staff were. Everyone on the bus heading back to the airport felt the same.Please do not let the few 'negative' reviews turn you off, Im VERY glad they didn't for me!!Thanks RIU BAMBU and see you soon!",

Everyone was extremely friendly. The food was very good. By the end of the week we would have liked a little bit more variety at the buffet ,but all in all very good. The A la carte's were very good. The Seafood Restaurant at the Riu Palace Macao was extremely good. (We went there twice.) The pool was clean. The beach just magnificent. We could walk for hours. Shopping was okay. I really didn't go to shop but still found some unique things to buy. We had no communication problems everyone spoke very good English. I read a lot of reviews before leaving and was a little worried. Now I know they must be hard people to please. We had a great experience and would go back in a heart beat. .",

        "content": "Great Vacation! My family and I got back from the RIU Bambu in the DR about 2 weeks ago (7-18 Aug in the DR and Bambu) and just now getting the time to write this review. I have been in the Army now for over 20 years and have been stationed all over the US and Germany. I have even done a couple of tours in Iraq. I mention this only give a frame of reference of where I am coming from. I have no idea about the people who did not have a great vacation. My family and I completely loved every minute of it. I did a pretty good job of looking at all the reviews before we booked the trip and for every 10 reviews there was about 1 negative one. After we booked the trip I started seeing several more bad reviews. This had me a bit worried. But I figured it must have been some very picky people. I saw the reviews about the rock hard beds and flat pillows. I had no problems with the bed or the pillows. They were fine. The room was a bit small but then again we were not in the room very much anyway.  I would like to talk about the good things at the Bambu and then I only have one comment for them to improve on. First the good things: The in room mini bar!! The mini bar in the room was great. I perfect touch when sitting on the balcony relaxing or waiting your turn for the shower. They come and refill the mini bar daily so you are never without your favorite drink. Next was the weather. Just incredible! Temps in the upper 80鈥檚 to mid 90鈥檚 the entire time. Just wonderful. The beach was one of the best I have ever seen. We have been to Hawaii, Spain, Cancun, Portugal, Tunisia and a few other all inclusive places. All seem to have there own charm but I can honestly say, that the beach was awesome at the Bambu. The ocean was just as nice. The pretty blue colors of the ocean were amazing to look at. The pure white sand was also just amazing. I really cannot think of anything negative about it.  Next I want to talk about the hotel staff. Again an area that I was a bit worried about. I read some reviews that said if you did not speak Spanish you were not waited on or not helped. Not true at all. I would say about 90% of the Hotel staff spoke English. In fact about 90% of the staff spoke 3-4 languages fluently. The staff was very friendly and always went out of their way to make you happy. They do work very hard and have long hours but I never saw any one of them complain. The staff also had some very nice shows in the evenings and there was always putting on things to do during the day. I thought the staff was very professional and you could tell they loved their job.  The hotel had several day trips for you to book. We decided to do two of them. Both were great and we had an awesome time. The Sanoma Island trip and the Party boat were both well worth it. I highly recommend either one. The food at the Bambu was perfect. Some reviews talked about the same thing being served over and over again. That was true to a point. Most nights there were things that they had the night before, but they also had many other items to chose from. Most nights there was a theme night. For example a Spanish night where there were lots of tacos, ect鈥?Even the nights were they had the same thing as the previous night, it was not bad at all. There was so much to choose from you did not have the same thing each night if you did not want to.  Ok now for the only area I was not happy with. The cleanliness of the pool was not the best. I thought for a nice hotel it was pretty bad actually. It did not stop me from swimming in the pool daily, but it really needed to be cleaned out. I think if they hire a 鈥減ool cleaner person鈥?who walked around 3-4 times a day to get the stuff that fell into the pool out it would have been much nicer. The pool itself was nice and again I was in it daily but at times it needed someone to get the floating stuff out. The pool bar however was great. The pool bar staff worked hard but always had a big smile on their face and every time I swam up to get a drink they would immediately have one for me. I liked the way they remembered what I was drinking and what my 10 year old daughter was drinking. I gave a few tips (dollars here and there) but I think they would have been just as nice even if I did not.  The last thing I want to bring up was how friendly the other guests staying there were. On my first day we meet a wonderful family from England (Gary, Linn Jess and Katie). It turned out that he had a daughter Jessica who was one year older than my daughter and Katie who was one year younger. They turned out to be good friends and played together as much as they could. It was great meeting them and we are still emailing back and forth. Hope to run into them again in a few years! Ok I think I have rambled on enough. After discussing it over with my wife, we had no trouble deciding this was one of the best vacations we have even been on. We plan on going back in the near future. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great time",

        "content": "Amazing beach! We just returned from a week at the RIU Bambu. I had read the negative reviews, but was optimistic anyways. The hotel is not bad, but is certainly not a 5 star. The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms are small, standard, and in need of renovating (hole in the tub). Very clean and great water pressure though. Mini bar with pop and beer, but the only water was in a gallon jug, no indivual bottles, which was disappointing. The air conditioning worked poorly, and a main factor in my disappointment was your room is the ONLY place in the hotel with air conditioning. Be prepared to be hot and sticky at dinner; less than enjoyable. Didn't even want the have a coctail at the bar after dinner or watch the entertainment since it was so hot and uncomfortable. Pool area crowded and could be cleaner, water way too warm. Beach area fantastic!! Plenty of chairs and your choice of sun or shade. Entertainment throughout the day is fun, your choice to join in or not. Service not the best. We brought plenty of money for tipping, but rarely received the service to give a tip. Drinks are great! Overall, ok hotel for the money, would rate a 3, not a 5.",

        "content": "Don't Get All the Bad Reviews My husband and I just returned yesterday from a 5 night trip to the Riu Bambu. I just don't understand how some of the reviews can be so very negative. Just so you know something about us - I travel in the States extensively for work (Federal Gov't), so I don't get to stay in hotels that are considered, by vacation standards, to be be more than 2-3 star hotels, we both ride motorcycles and love to fish. I love to read, love the tropics and beaches. My only request when traveling is that I have a clean room and clean sheets on my bed. My husband hunts and plays golf but not much of a travel-type person; therefore, tends to be a bit more high maintenance when we do travel together. We both were very pleased with our stay at Riu Bambu. We stayed in Building 3 in Rm 312, second floor - very close to everyting and located on the left side of the resort (looking in from the beach). We had an issue with the air conditioning not working, called front office and within minutes, literally, it was repaired and we had more air than we needed. One afternoon the hot water wasn't working. A pipe had broken and the whole building was without hot water. We called, they came, we went to the beach. By the time we came back they had already exposed and repaired the pipe and hot water was working - this took less than 3 hours. By the time we came back from dinner, same day, the hole was filled in and plants were replanted and you couldn't tell anything had ever happened. - alot quicker than we are having the water pipes fixed from recent storms here in Maryland (USA) (two days and counting)!!!! This is not a new resort and things can break down; however, never was an issue and definitely did not affect our vacation. This resort is absolutely beautiful, spaceous, and the location is the best on the beach. I have seen most of the Caribbean and this beach was the most unique in that it had a forest of palm trees right on the beach. The beach was very wide and there was plenty of open sunny places on the beach as well (for all us sun worshippers). Never had a problem with finding chairs. Everything was very clean and never had a problem with cleanliness in the room or anywhere else. The food was good for us as we are not picky and only there for 5 days. We did not get sick, which was my greatest concern since we both like to take advantage of eating different foods and drinking all the specialty drinks. Took a Pepto Bismal chewable tablet every morning and started taking acidophylis two weeks prior to trip and during. Doctor prescribed cipro (antibiotic), just in case, but didn't need it.The beds were a bit hard, but oddly enough, neither of us minded it. We took snacks for the room but never ate them, as we weren't in the room long enough to need them. We even took some small battery operated fans to cool off on the beach - what were we thinking?! - the breeze was constant and perfect on the beach.Took our own towels but never unpacked them. Never a problem with towel thieves.Left tips everywhere we went because that's what we do, but didn't notice that anyone was treated differently - service with a smile and Hola for everyone - and we did notice more people did not leave tips than did - too bad.My only regret on this trip was that it was way too short. We will definitely go back to the Riu Bambu and, for the life of me, I don't get the bad reviews!!!",

        "content": "Just back- April 12-19- Loved it ! Just back from Riu Bambu. April 12-19- fantastic time!Our first time to Punta Cana and just loved it. Apple Vacations charter with Ryan Airlines out of Boston, direct to Punta Cana. A very relaxing week, we did no excursions.I must say, I don鈥檛 know where some of the complaints that I鈥檝e read about are coming from. They must be extremely picky and unhappy people. We could find no fault.FLIGHT: Flight was delayed an hour coming and going, which was annoying, but other than that, no complaints. Movie shown during the flight, had to purchase headphones for $5 unless you had the foresight to bring your own. They sold sandwiches for $5 each, also, complimentary beverages and some chips. AIRPORT: Departed plane on the tarmac, which was a treat, stepping out into balmy air. For some reason, they held us on the ground for awhile before allowing us to proceed into the terminal. We paid out arrival fee of $10 per person, found our baggage and apple rep fairly quickly, and were on our way to the Riu Bambu at 10:30 pm. The driver dropped us off first. RESORT/ROOM: Check it was quick, they assigned us Bldg 28, which was fine. I鈥檇 emailed requesting Bldg. 25, but as it was close enough, didn鈥檛 say anything, as they had the papers all made out in advance. We were quite happy with our room, a very short walk, and it was very clean and all you need. There was a crack in the wall up near the ceiling, but heard from someone who stayed at a better resort, that their wall had cracks too. Overall, it was very comfortable, the beds were firm, but we got used to them. We were very glad we鈥檇 brought our pillows, as suggested. I don鈥檛 know what the complaints were about regarding the bedding. I thought the sheets and bedspread were fine, and of a perfect weight for the air conditioning. . Bedspreads could do with updating to a pretty floral, perhaps, instead of the rather dull blue. The only other preference would have been for a bureau instead of the desk with 6 small drawers, but after hanging as much as we could, we had plenty of room. Bath towels were plentiful and nice and thick, as were the pool towels. LAYOUT OF RESORT: We absolutely loved the smallness and layout of the resort. It was such a short walk from room to lobby and on the the pools and beach. We explored all of the adjacent RIU鈥檚 as well as the Iberostar, and despite the grandness of some of the others, would prefer to return here because of the size. DINING: We never did get to try one of the ala cartes. One day the Steak house was available, but not till 9pm, so we decided to stick with the buffets, which were fine. Food was good- some nights great, and you could always find something you liked to eat. Breakfast was our favorite with omelettes to order and yummy croissants, pancakes and French toast were wonderful also. I was disappointed in the desserts. They looked beautiful, but all tasted the same, rather bland. We ate lunch at Mamajuanas after the first day. POOLS; The only thing I wish they鈥檇 had was a 鈥渜uiet pool鈥?for adults. The children鈥檚 pool was right next to the main pool, and the towel game was on in full force. But since we preferred quiet, we stayed under the palms on the beach. I was surprised at some women going topless around the children鈥檚 pool. I thought that was supposed to be reserved for the beach, but people just don鈥檛 care!BEACH: The beach was spectacular, and after walking the beach all the way to the beach markets, feel ours was the biggest and best, even over the larger hotels. Plenty of sun loungers available. We spent all our time there, a short walk to the bar.BARS: Bars were great- always cheerful and accommodating in whatever you wanted. SHOPPING; We walked up the beach vendors one day, and were a bit disappointed. After hearing from everyone, including our Apple rep to offer a third of what they quote, we found that they would not even take $5 for a tshirt- they quoted $10, which is what the gift shops in the resort were asking, so bought them there instead. I did get a set of Larimar necklace, earrings, bracelet for $25. He started out asking $65. Bought one of the small paintings at the resort with the Taino symbols on it for $10. STAFF: We found all the staff very friendly and helpful. Some didn鈥檛 speak any English at all, which wasn鈥檛 a problem until I was trying to ask the masseuse if she could shut the hut鈥檚 door for privacy. I finally gave up, figuring to just let it go- there was much more being exposed on the beach than what might be glimpsed of me getting the massage! Animation staff was wonderful- always something going on, but if you didn鈥檛 want to participate, they left you alone. DEPARTURE: Quickly went through checkin and security with no problems as mentioned on previous posts regarding luggage weight or going through bags. They didn鈥檛 even have us remove our shoes, and never looked in a thing. Again, they walked us out on the tarmac to board, holding us up at one point for a while again, for some unknown reason, and then boarding from both front and rear of plane. Immigration and Customs was effortless at Boston. OVERALL: We absolutely loved it and would consider coming back to this resort again. It鈥檚 not the grandest, but size trumps opulence for us, in this case!",

Don't expect to go into town. We paid $70.00 to be taken to a supermarket. they do not have markets to buy souvenirs. The hotel products are very expensive. Drinks were very water downed.

For all of you out there who are worrying about all the negative comments, IGNORE THEM! The Riu Bambu is amazing, just like any other Riu hotel because the chain is fantastic. My mom and I are actually travelling to Riu Vallarta next week which is in Puerto Vallarta. We have been to many Riu's, such as this one, Riu Palace in Cabo San Lucas, as well as Riu Cancun (the name says it all).Food, ENTERTAINMENT (#1), Beach, Service..its all amazing!If you want good entertainment, go to the Riu Bambu in Domenican and NO WHERE ELSE! EVeryone else from the Palaces would be at the Bambu at night getting the best entertainment!Overall, the RIu Bambu is amazing and we were going to return this year but we are going to try something new! However, most likely next march break I will be returning with a group of friends!Enjoy your stay everyone!",

        "content": "Riu Bambu leaves a lot to be desired After the excitement of booking this trip, the actual visit was a letdown.Rooms 鈥?upon arrival we had small spider/aphid like bugs in our room and asked to have it sprayed. This was done right away and worked for a few days, but needed to be re-sprayed and there were always a few around. Beds very firm, pillows very thin and hard. Bathroom water pressure fine, but rust around tub. Food 鈥?Well, the hot food was hot, the cold food was cold. Not much variety from day to day. Yes a few dishes were different every day, but was very repetitious. Having said that, you could always find something to eat. A la Cartes 鈥?the Caribe Grill is fantastic, but you have to be in the lobby to line up to book by about 6:50 a.m. Steakhouse 鈥?so so.Bars/seating areas - very crowded, not enough room for everyone. On a popular show night, we sat at the table by 6:30 p.m., then ate our meals in shifts so we could save our spot. Otherwise by showtime there was absolutely no place to sit.Front desk staff 鈥?Friendly, English not a problem while I was there. On one occasion we needed to call our Sunquest Rep and asked to use the desk phone. We were asked to pay for the $2.00 connection fee. When this came up while talking with our Sunquest Rep, we shouldn鈥檛 have had to pay. The clerk was probably pocketing the money. Our Rep arranged a gift from the hotel for the inconvenienceAnimation team 鈥?AMAZING!! They work so hard and are happy all the time. Very friendly and mingle with the guests all day.Beach 鈥?WOW!! Not one rock in site, however water very rough. Out of 14 days 9 were red flag, 4 were yellow, and 1 was green. Had to be at the beach by 9:30 to get a lounge chair. Is it a 5 star? Not a chance. Would I go back? To the Dominican 鈥?yes in a heartbeat. To the Riu Bambu 鈥?no. As a matter of fact I was so disappointed, I will not go to another Riu in any country.",

My wife and I are easy to please, just decent room and beach with food and drink and were good. But this cant be a 5 star, mold in rooms, tiny compared to others, no fitted sheets, thin blankets like scratchy wool and no ocean view and barely any pool view rooms. We compared the rooms at the taino and naiboa and they are the same, small block with bare essentials. I have stayed in punta cana and resorts like the Palladium are a true 5 star. The reason they call this a 5 star is the people staying here are giving this place better reviews than it deserves. Stay somewhere else and compare, or stay here and stay ignorant.... Next time I am booking direct with another resort rated by funjet or other travel booker. Apple Vacations you lost our twice yearly business, enough said.",

The room:The room was always clean and the cleaners cleaned the rooms daily and left fresh towels on the bed positioned like swans etc. The fridge was refilled every other day, but by request the will restock the fridge with specified drinks. Optics in the room, maintained. The Hotel public areas: Standard of cleanliness through out the hotel was good except American refused to use the hand cleaning product the hotel provided as you enter the restaurants.Food: The Buffet restaurant offered a wide selection of foods catering for the different nationalities, plenty of salads etc, so americans not happy that there is no burgers and chips every day - I think most other guests liked the wide selection and non Stodge food that I have found in USA.Drink: Wide selection of hot, cold and alcoholic drinks, but brand names are not readily available, but what do you expect when it is all included in the price? Variety of cocktails available - with a daily special.Beach:The beach is private so no hassle from people selling you things, there are a couple of drinks huts on the beach. The sports beach which is at the far end of the resort has motorised and non motorised sports, (only non motorised are included in the all inclusive offer) Entertainment:There is as much as you want to join in with - personally I am not in to that sort of thing, but there seemed to be plenty on offer",

        "content": "lovely holiday We stayed here for 2wks mid sept '07. We emailed ahead and asked for a high floor quiet room ( fear of 8 legged creepy crawlies  light sleeper) So well done Bambu, block 33 best sleep ever on all hols in last 8yrs!! Flight was very good Thomson new roomier planes food was ok films etc good. A little tight with the baggage allowance worth paying for the extra 5 kilos. Transfer was quick efficient and the roads have improved since my last visit in March 07. Arrival and check-in smooth and only a 20min wait for the bags so on the beach in less than 90 mins from landing must be a record for me!! Mark the rep was simply the best knowledgeable, interesting, knew what he was doing, great personality and 100% dedicated to the job nothing was to much trouble for him.The room was filled with towel swans and flowers everyday by a sweet 18yr old who earned $200 per month for a 10 hour day so I suggest if you are going to tip the the girls deserve it, The bar staff make a packet from the Americans who think its fine to give $1 everytime they get a round in and leave the rest of us to fight to get their attention!! The tourists, when we arrived from Manchester (Mondays, Gatwick Thursdays) there were about 200 of us Brits. Ok I know what you are all going to say but Please, Please, Please! Is there anywhere on the Planet that the GERMANS don't go on holiday so the rest of us can be free of their bad mannered, chain smoking arrogance. The problem with this hotel is it's Hamburg with tropical beach. We found out why, on carribean street situated between the Riu Maccao and the Taino is a TUI office which serves the Europeans in the resort now they do speak English and on asking the if they could book us a holiday direct with them this is what we were told, they only book holidays for Main land Europe and if we chose to go say to Paris and book there that was fine. So she kindly gave us a brochure and price list, some of the travellers were there for 10 weeks all inc. Now our Thomson agents don't do that as it's an arm and a leg but if you did want to go for that length of time it will cost you 5500 Euro for a junior suite at the Punta Cana Princess next door which is much more luxurious, so somewhere along the line us Brits are getting done! The weather was faultless, the food good no dellie belly named brands of alcohol if you want them. Do buy earplugs for the shower as quite a few people with ear infections. Overall a really good holiday. Only suggestion for the Hotel are newer pillows for the beds as old ones are wafer thin and tv's need updating . A new manager has arrived and is keeping all staff on their toes. I'd give this hotel 10/10 for location to a wide clean beach, 8/10 for staff and 9/10 for value for money. Would I go again? Yes.Enjoy your stay.",

So, we tried the ala carte restaurants where reservations could only be made between 7am and 10am the day of (very annoying). This food was worse than the buffet food to the point where people were walking out in the midst of their meals. Specifically, the Steak House was horrible. My steak was medium rare and I have never chewed so hard on a piece of steak - it was like beef jerky. And, the restaurant was the regular Mama Juana dining pavilion with a section set aside for Steak House and Mediterrean. Also, I found several insects in my food.- bad drinks - the drinks were all sugar, no alcohol and not very diverse. What bar can't make a mudslide? Also the bars smelled a little like rotten fruit- unaccomodating staff (1) they ran out of pool towels at 10am and would not hand out more until 3:00 (2)we didnt get maid service on our second day and they would not call housekeeping to the room when we called the front desk - they told us to wait until the next day and would not give us fresh towels in the mean time (3) no change at the water sports booth - so when we gave $10 for the $3 daily insurance - they couldnt make the $7 change - so we had to walk around with hand written IOUs and hope they had change the next day - bugs in rooms - bed bugs, floor bugs, you name it bugs- awful bedding - pushy resort staff walking up and down beach constantly trying to sell extra activities- no ATM on resort",

        "content": "Great Holiday My husband and I stayed at the Riu Bambu from 31st October for 2 weeks. We are both 35 and quite well travelled.The other reviews that have been submitted pretty much cover our points so we will try to keep it brief.Travel - We travelled with Thomson. Flight and transfers were really good and we found the Thomson reps to be informative and friendly. Transfer took about 45 mins from airport and the check in at the hotel was quick and well organised. So much so that we were in our room with 10 minutes. Transfer back to airport and return flight also on time and no problems.Rooms - Cleaned immaculatley every day. Fresh towels and bedding on a dialy basis. We requested extra pillows and they were brought to our room within 10 minutes. Air-con worked well and rooms also had a cieling fan. Clean bathrooms and a good selection of toiletries. Mini Bar in room was well stocked and replenished every 2 daysFood - We had read alot of mixed reports on the food so didnt quite know what to expect. We didnt eat alot but this was partly because it was so hot. The main buffet restaurnat was great, lots of choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are theme nights every week such as carribean and mexican and the staff really work hard to make sure everyone has a great night. There are also 3 A La Carte restaurants. The menus were limited but the food and service was first class. The only complaint we would have was that the main restaurnat was very hot at all times and is in desperate need of air-con.Pool - Pools were clean and always well maintained. Larger pool with swim up bar at times did get noisy but if pool games arent your thing then there is a quieter smaller pool.Beach - This really was the highlight of the whole holiday. The beach was stunning. Powdery white sand and clear blue sea. Lots of sunbeds avaliable all day and natural shade if you need it. The beach was really clean and well maintained. Pool and beach towels are avaliable.Entertainment - Lots going on throughout the day from volleyball to darts! But no pressure to get involved if you just want to enjoy a Pina Colanda by the pool. Evening entertainment did seem to revolve around kids such as kids disco and talent competitions. If you dont have kids though there are plently of places to just enjoy a quiet drink.Overall - We had a great holiday and would recommend the Riu Bambu to anyone looking for a relaxing and informal holiday. The weather was fantastic the whole 2 weeks. We did have rain most days but this seemed to be on a evening or late afternoon and wasnt a problem as only lasted 20 minutes. We did find it very humid on an evening but daytimes were really pleasant.Just a few tips:Make sure you take all medication etc with you. We were not ill but did hear of people spending 拢7 on a tube of Savlon in the hotel shop!Swimming with the sharks was a great day out. About 拢40 each and worth every penny.VIP lounge can be booked for 拢13 per person for your wait at Punta Cana airport on return flight. Its great vlaue as all drinks and snacks are included as well as internet terminals and comfortable seating and air con.Sorry, not so brief afterall!",

That is one thing that i enjoyed about the bambu that the staff are awesome. some late nights the night bar staff would let me go behind the bar and pour some beers and make some drinks for people. the food is not that good. it gets very repititive and there isnt a lot of alternatives. the 24hr snakc bar is a joke! i was expecting to go there at 2am and find something really good to eat. not the case, instead i found 12hr old hot dogs that tasted awful. terrible!! if u r looking to buy some gifts do not buy from caribbean street, instead there are vendors about 20min walk down the beach. these guys can be talked down to less than 60-75% of their asking price. however, i urge you not to buy cigars from them or anyone else in the resort. only buy from a government run store in town. now then, your all probably wondering if it sounds so good why is he writing only a neutral report. here it is...i dont know how but i got the most sick i have been in years. my symptons were headache, fever (103), extreme sore throat, and vomiting. i never drank any of the unpurified water so it leaves me to believe its from the food. and if its from the food how are you supposed to protect yourself??...not eat? honestly it was the worst ive been sick since i can remember and i wouldnt wish that on anyone, especially someone on vacation. oh and if yer a single guy goin with buddies, do yourself a favour go somewhere else, theres no single girls here. it consists of couples mostly all european. i find that spanish people from spain are incredibly rude to the point where i almost ended his vacation! ok well beware and thank you.Steve",

All are excellent one their own, Bambu is the best yet, from our perceptive. Nice room excellent service, fantastic food. We ate at the buffet every day, breakfast and dinner. Selections were great. themed dinners ( mexican, Dominican, BBQ,) the seafood is awesome shrimp lobster oh my god it was awesome. We ate everything and no one got ill. However, eating fresh fruit and salads, and spicy foods are part of our daily diets. Drinking, ask the bartender to make you thier special drink. I highly recommend the  el Boney at the pool bar. Go prepared... take plenty of sunscreen ( pack twice what you think you'll need, the water and sun will require frequent reapplication) you can pay more than $16.00 USD for a new bottle.Take isolated mugs, you will be happy for a cool drink while lazing on your lounger.Take a raft type item for drifting in the sea.The beach flea market was not for us, pushie aggressive vendors, however it is a nice walk up the beach.",

        "content": "Shame about the rain I was unsure what to expect after all the negative reviews, however this was a great place for a relaxing holiday. The only thing that spoiled it was the weather. It rained continuously for 10 out of 14 days. I would suggest avoiding the month of May. The hotel was very clean. There were no roaches in our room or the hall way. The food was good and plentiful. We were never sick and ate pretty much everything. The only complaint I have is about the entertainment. I recognise that the team work very hard long hours however the shows are quite repetative, at times quite unprofessional and when it is raining no additional entertainment was provided and as a result spent more time watching TV on this holiday than any other. Staff were very helpful and friendly. There are very little shops so dont worry about excess baggage on return journey as theres nothing to buy.Manarium is the excursion where you swim with sharks and rays and was excellent value. Took a trip on a helicopter which was a great way to see the coast line. Without a doubt the best thing about this holiday was the beach. Just as well as this is pretty much all there is in this area. It is huge with white sand and clear blue sea. We never had a problem getting a lounger and there was plenty of space, infact even when the sun shone the beach never looked crowded.A great value for money relaxing beach holiday best suited to couples and famalies. We may return but at a different time of year.",

        "content": "Eat Lots Before You Go! Just got back from the Riu Bambu ( feb. 21 - 28 ) The food was really BAD and the wine well impossible to drink. I did book last minute and that was the only place available (not a good sign). Rooms are okay nothing special and mine came with an upgrade I guess; I had hundreds of tiny ants. Since I was travelling alone, I did not mind them and by the end of the week they were gone. Maybe they didn't like my music. Did I tell you how bad the food was? Don't understand how this place got a 5 star rating. I read reviews were some people liked the food. Man you guys need to go out more. Also tons of children and sadly most of them orphans or the parents spend the day at the bar trying to forget they had kids.If you like chatting with other guests, I suggest you bring a German translator. Food is really bad except for soups, deserts and the fries were okay. So for my main course I had a banana and fries. On a more positive note, I was not sick; then again it's pretty hard to get sick on BANANAS. Everyday the buffet is the same; I guess they were afraid to change a good thing. It was nice to come home to a good bottle of Shiraz and week old leftover in my fridge. (DELICACY)Conclusion; If you can survive on very little food, then this is the place. The weather was nice and the beach is beautiful. Good news from my doctor this morning; He thinks I will make a full recovery. PS In case I forgot, the food is really bad. BON VOYAGE!",

        "content": "A Wonderful Vacation! We just returned from our vacation at the Riu Macao - Punta Cana 30 March-April 6! We had a WONDERFUL time and would go back again! After reading the reviews over the past several months there were times I was seconding guessing our choice and times I couldn't get to Punta Cana fast enough. We booked our vacation throught our travel agentApple Vacations. We flew USA 3000 - great service - the plane was a bit cramped for my husband, but for the kids (14/12 yrs) and myself we were confortable. Upon arrival at the airport after retrieving your luggage, we were greated by a Apple Representative who directed us to our bus. The bus ride to the hotel is roughly about 35 minutes to the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the front desk with a smile and tropical punch. The room was spotless but did smell a bit at first. No problem - opened the sliders to the balcony and lit some candles that we had brought along with some fabreeze sheets for the closet (a suggestion I got from this site). We never seem to have the smell the rest of the trip - when we were in the room we always had the sliders open. The room was SPOTLESS and we all found the beds  pillows surprising comfortable - many complained the beds were too hard - we like a firm mattress so there was no complaint there. There is something to do for EVERYONE of EVERY AGE. The Activity Directors had plenty of things to do for everyone. ..volleyball, dance lessons, darts, bocce, ping pong, aerobics, etc. You can choose to participate or not. The beach is absolutely BONITO! The pool is also enjoyable ...we NEVER ever had a problem finding a chair at the pool or the beach and we were not down at the break of dawn for reserve a chair for 4. The food is good with the buffet offering the most variety for everyone. Sometimes some of the meat was overcooked, but there is some much to choose from fish, meat, pasta, salad, fruit , cheeses, etc. and service with a smile. Everyone was pleasant ,spoke English and gave us a chance to practice our Spanish! There were visitors from all countries US, Canada, England, Germany, Italy - a nice diversity.Just a hint in regards to water sports and tennis - you need to reserve early (the day before most likely) if you want to make sure you get a sailfish, paddleboat, etc. and court. Excursions we participated in and enjoyed was the Jungle Safari ask for Danny Boy (the guide) he is fabulous (enjoyed the most), The snorkeling/swimming w/ nurse sharks/ray and the Quad tour. Would go back in a heart beat!",

        "content": "EHHH....I've had better I've been to Punta Cana twice, compared to the other hotel I stayed at, this hotel was in major need of some help. First let's start with the good: Rooms were in little houses of 4 rooms per bungalow, which meant privacy. The minibar and minifrige were pretty nice, which included an array of different liquors. The staff was all really nice and helpful with an exception. My room did not smell like other people's expierience. The pools were nice too. They had little shops and a really cool club that plays a mixture of music. Now the bad. The front desk staff were the exception to the nice staff. They were completely unorganized and rude. The rooms don't use key cards, just keys. If you charge anything to your room be prepared to pay cash. THEY DON'T EXCEPT CREDITCARDS!!! The minibar and frige are stocked every other day. The worst of all, I had to hike to get to the pool, the front desk, and the beach. Some are closer and some are not, like mine was. The whole area is like a maze, YOU WILL GET LOST, all the houses look the same, take the map, that is given to you. Overall I would rate this hotel 2-3 out of 5 stars. Like my title states, I've had better....",

Reception: We checked in within minutes and after nicely asking Joanna (who was extremley helpful) to be put in a room closest to the beach, she did it with no problem and no extra charge. Jose was a young, funny, and helpful young man who worked the front desk and who helped me many many times during our week stay. He gave us an umbrella after we lost ours for no charge, a converter for my hair straightner and battery chargers and such, also for no charge. The front desk staff was excellent to myself and my husband. Upon arrival we were given ice cold fruit punch and were escorted to our room (it was quite late out).The Rooms: They were clean, well lit and comfortable. We had 3 beds in which one we used for shopping and extra storage space. The safe was at no charge and I did not find any problems with it. We felt safe and comfortable leaving over $4000 US in there, including ipods, cameras, cell phones etc. The shower pressure was great and even at the busy times we never ran out of hot water. The mini was a bonus!!!! Rum, rye, vodka and gin were stocked every second day, including many different kinds of pop and a large jug of water. The AC worked very well and we often found it a litlle chilly (still not complaing!)The Food, Bars and Service: Excellent. For those that like the ala cart meals, you can book as many as you like between the hours of 7 and 10 am. We ate ala cart 4 times in a week and were very pleased. The staff was AMAZING!!!! We spent most of our time in the little Coco's bar. The drinks were made of good quality booze and they offered a martini menu after 6pm. Victor, Abel and Carlitos were the main bartenders there, they made sure that we were ALWAYS looked after. They truly made our stay that much more special.All in all, the Riu Taino was a $@!#% of a deal for the treatment that we recieved. The resort is small enough that you are never more than 10 minutes from the beach, yet big enough that even after a week we still had lots to do. The pools were clean and water sports were included. If you do not walk into their country with your head up your $@!#% and demand and boss them around, you will be treated like a princess. I was at least :)",

We were then walked to the Taino with Hotel employees bringing our bags. Check in was Fast only 2 mins and we were taken to our Bungalow! One point the rooms at the Taino have a Main power Switch as soon as you come in the door it is on the Right side it turns off all power to the room lights, tv, clock everything. (caught us off gaurd walked back and was told how to turn it on) Room was decent not amazing but suits the purpose. Tv worked and even had a few English Channels!Beach was Amazing nice blue water! warm and very enjoyable! Always found 2 chairs to sit on even after an excursion getting back at 13:00 there were still chairs! Pool was Nice and pool bar was good! A little harder to get chairs at the pool usaly by 8:30 they were all reserved (good old towel game) Staff were Fantasitc and very very friendly Wilken in the main buffet was great and always helpfull! Buffet were good never had a problem finding somthing to eat we are not pickey eaters but there should never be a problem finding food!! We ate at 2 of the dinners we ate at the Mexican wich was GREAT, food was fresh tastey and HOT! the second one we tried was the Steak house.. Out of my 7 days there this was my only complaint with the hole trip!! the prepared dinner here was just plain BAD all of it the steaks were really bad i had chicken that wasnt cooked the vegies were either WAY passed cooked or just bad!! i would not let this ruin my night so we just went to the buffet and filled up on Great food!Tips: Tips are included in your stay but that doesnt mean you shouldnt Tip its apreciated and sometimes it gets you the little extra. We tiped our Maid $2 every day and also put out little gifts for her also every day. Our Fridge was stocked every day and i left a not asking for more Brama beer and Pepesi and they were restocked every day! i left them a $2 tip also with usaly a pack of Gum!! We tried to sit in the same area in the Buffet for our meals so we could use the same people and when we recevied good service we tiped!!Excursions- we chose 2 excusions we went on the Carribien Festivle and Tropical Storm. in our opinion the Tropical storm was way better. it was alot of fun and every one enjoyed themselfs turned out to be a major Party and alot of drinkin and alot of Dancing what a great Time staf on the boat was Awsome and Capt Jose was a great Guy... when we were done this cruise we wanted to book it again it was that good and that much FUN!!!Carrabien Festivle was Fun alot more relaxed alot more Family Orientated and getting to see the Nurse Sharks and hold the Manta Rays was really neat Also.. was a little Rushed at the sharks and rays and wasnt as much Fun as Tropical storm but still nice!!hints of what to take... we didnt see ANY bugs at all.. my best advice would be to take a Thermal mug i took a 30oz and my wife took a 20oz and the bartenders had no problem filling them up for us.. Worked great.. Also bring gifts for the locals or employees its a nice thought!Our Sunquest Rep Jorge was Awsome great help and easy to talk to he help make things great for use!Anyways My Wife and i are looking forword to Returning to this Hotel again SOON we would recomend it to Anyone that wants to have a great time and relax.. if you have any questions just ask!Adanac00 and wife!",

Overall our trip was pleasant - beautiful beach, great staff, moderately decent food but we definitely did not feel that we received good value.Good points:- close to airport- beautiful and well kept beach- all aspects of the facility are within a quick walking distance- excellent staffChallenges:- the beds are like sleeping on concrete and the bedding is poor at best- the food is moderate and quite boring - they serve the same thing again and again...- their advertising is misleading - there was no child care center on site and no restaurants on site - only 2 buffets - although the buffet indicates otherwise- don't even think about sleeping before midnight as the pounding of the disco is everywhereOverall, our trip was pleasant but they should be clear on their advertising as we felt mislead and they should drop the rating to a 3 star.",

        "content": "not a four star We stayed at the Riu Taino Jan 13 thru Jan 16. This was my first time visiting the Dominican and probably the last. I have stayed in several Riu hotels in Mexico and Jamaica and have always loved what the RIU offers, my mom even wears their staff shirt!We thought with a Riu it has to be nice, wrong. I hate when reviews drone on about the negatives so let me keep it simple. I'll start with the positives. The beach is amazing, just beautiful. The water was chilly, but I expected that for this time of year. There was always plenty of beach chairs so you could always find somewhere nice to sit. There is a flea market at the end of the beach, but if you're not a haggler don't go. I would rather pay the extra dollar and shop in peace at Carribean Street. They have basically the same merchandise. If you think you'll be warm in the pool, guess again. The pool was to cold to swim in, I only got in once, after several daquiris.The drinks were always tasty but the bartenders could care less how long it takes to serve you. They also speak very little English and do not make an attempt to let you understand them. no salt for your margherita is not in the Spanish language. My biggest problem with this resort is how indifferent the staff is about pleasing you. I'm not pampered by any means but they are very rude. The cashier in the hotel gift shop was upset with me because after asking her to sit items to purchase off to the side, she rang them up anyway. I told her i would come back in an hour with the money she rolled her eyes and gave me dirty look. She told my friend to tell what size t-shirt she was looking for so she would quit unfolding them!Upon check-in we were told the room would not be ready for an hour. We ate and cameback. We were taken to our room but the maid was still cleaning...we watched her clean for 20 more minutes! The room was very small with one double bed and two twin size beds! Do you go on vacation to sleep in a twin bed? The room was mustier than the usual smell, but fortunately I had brought an air freshener. The fridge in our room kept things luke warm with no temperature dial. It was on the second day we realized you had to wedge it up against the wall to keep it shut!Europeans seem to out number the Americans here. I'm not sure why but they seem to be the rudest here than I have ever experienced. They cut in front of you in line and bump into you as if you weren't even there. We found a wallet one day and tracked the people down ourselves. We weren't sure the hotel staff would bother returning it. They rewarded us with two Italian bottles of champagne! They were probably the nicest people we met whole time.These problems were only a fraction of the things that went on. I think this could be a great resort with a little time and effort, but it definitely needs improvement both physically and with the attitudes of customer satisfaction. I hope this has been helpful. I wish we had shopped for a better place. Maybe you would be better off at the Palace.",

There are hotels bigger or newest than Taino (it was built in 1991) but the atmosphere there is incredible. It seems to be a big family, all the employers are really friendly,all, even the managers are amazing, Santiago, Franklin and Luna are the best.They are the hole day walking around the hotel,rooms,pool,beach.bars,restaurants, asking the clients if everything is ok (I never saw that in any hotel), if they need something to improve their holidays.Thank you so much, Riu Taino, I`ll come back there.",

        "content": "Great Experience at Riu Taino Our family (2 adults, two teenagers) stayed at the Riu Taino February 18-25, 2005. We had a wonderful time and would go back. Our only prior experience in Punta Cana was at the Barcelo Palace, and we would rate the two as roughly equivalent, with the Riu Taino having the edge for liveliness and staff friendliness, and the Barcelo having slightly better accommodations and food. We arrived at the Riu Taino on a Friday mid-afternoon. Since we did not take a charter, we arrived at the hotel by taxi (arranged in advance through Coco Tours, the local agent of TNT Tours) not tour bus, so there was no crowd at check in. We had scoped out the room locations in advance, and had e-mailed the hotel prior to arrival for a room closer to the beach. The hotel had e-mailed us back, indicating that they could not guarantee location, since it was their busy season. We initially were assigned to a room at the back of the property (near the Naiboa), but after some persistent (but nice) urging, the reception staff located rooms opening up the next day closer to the beach. The reception staff, particularly Rossy, was very helpful and attentive, and spoke English very well. We moved the next day, and were very happy with the location. We had two rooms on the second floor, which worked out well since our teenagers were right next to us.  We liked the bungalow set up of the Riu Taino, rather than large buildings like some other hotels. Our one complaint about the rooms (hopefully the Riu management reads these reviews) is that they really need updating, particularly as to curtains and bedding. We are more interested in the beach, pool, restaurants, etc., and did not spend much time in the room, so this was not a big deal to us. The cleaning staff deserves kudos for dealing with the mess left each day by two teenage girls. We made sure to leave a few dollars each day as our way of thanking the cleaning staff. The restaurants were satisfactory, but nothing special. We thought the food was a touch better at the Barcelo Palace, although we certainly never went hungry. We really liked the fact that food was available almost any time of day (until about mid night). When the main dining room is closed, you can get hot snacks, fruit, coffee, soda, etc. at the pizza restaurant on Caribbean Street or at the main bar area near the pool. There are two seatings, since the main restaurant is not large enough to accommodate everyone. We were assigned to the 8:30 seating, which we initially thought we would not like, but didn't try to change and actually ended up liking the late dinner (we would get a late afternoon snack at the bar to hold us over). We exercised the same caution with buffet food as we would in the U.S. We stuck to the hot food, fruits, pizza and breads, and stayed away from the salad bars and cold food. (The salad bar and cold food looked fine, just our self-imposed caution.) We did not experience or hear anyone else complain about any of the illness problems that have garnered a lot of attention. The hotel was extremely clean, and they seemed to go out of their way to keep it that way. We didn't notice a flying or walking bug the whole time. The food definitely reflected the European clientele, with a number of hot dishes with a Germanic tone to them. We would have liked to see more grilled to order fish and chicken, rather than grilled foods prepared in advance and then set out in pans. There was plenty of red meats, but we are not heavy meat eaters, so we can't attest to the quality. The clientele definitely was heavily European, with a large percentage of Germans, some French, and a variety of others (Italy, Eastern Europe, etc.). There was a heavy contingent of wild and crazy English speaking Canadians (is there any other type?), but just a few Americans. Contrary to some reports, the Germans were just fine, but somewhat more reserved, which could be misinterpreted as rude. Our casual observation was, nonetheless, the closer you got to the buffet, the more likely you were to have a close encounter with a German senior citizen coming back for more.  The Europeans smoke incessantly, which we also observed at the Barcelo Palace. It was shocking to see mid-teen Europeans chain smoking in front of their parents. The ventilation was good everywhere except the disco and the bar off the lobby, so this was not a huge problem. The animacion staff, particularly Rigo, Rosa, Jimy and their boss (never did get his name) were great. For us, this was the key difference which likely will cause us to return to the Riu Taino over the Barcelo Palace. The pool area was a buzz of activity, and the staff extremely energetic and friendly. I never got the feeling that anyone was looking for a tip, although we handed out plenty of tips just before we left to thank the animacion staff for making our trip so great. The beach is beautiful, although less intimate than the Barcelo Palace. We had a particularly windy week, so we ended up spending more time at the pool than we had anticipated. The pool chairs were reserved early (by 8 a.m. they were gone), but that was not a problem for us since I got up early each morning for a run on the beach. For you runners out there, the beach is more suited to running than at the Barcelo Palace, since it is wider with more of a water line (so you don't have to run on heavy sand). Having run a half-hour or so in each direction, I can attest that the Riu Taino has the best beach in sight.  We did not spend much time at the other Riu hotels. The Riu Palace looked beautiful, but was too fancy for our tastes (we go away to dress down, not dress up). The Riu Bambu was much newer, but we liked the location of the Riu Taino, which was closer to the beach and Caribbean street. We were much more comfortable letting our teenagers stay out late at the disco on Caribbean street since it was just minutes from the Riu Taino, but farther from the Riu Bambu. Our only complaint, if you call it that, is that the Riu needs to exercise closer control over the independent vendors they allow on the property. We had a bad experience with the hairdresser (for braiding) on Caribbean Street, which has a booth at the pool. We were willing to pay more than the braiding at the market down the beach, for the convenience of having it done at the pool. The braiding was not the way my 14 year old daughter had described (probably a language problem), but when we asked them to correct it, they wanted to charge us another $20. The money was insignificant, but we objected to paying more just to get it right. The owner of the hair salon was extremely aggressive, going to the extent of trying to get the manager of the Riu Taino to force us to pay. Fortunately, the manager, a very nice guy from Spain, backed us up 100%.  Also, the hotel allows outside vendors into the hotel lobby once a week to show their wares, mostly jewelry, cigars, paintings and tee shirts. This is fine with us, but we felt uncomfortable since the vendors were aggressive in trying to get us to buy. This is fine when this happens at the beach market, but not on the hotel property. These minor complaints, however, hardly detracted from our overall experience. We would rate the Riu Taino a solid 4+ star (by Punta Cana standards), and it would be a 5 star with a little cosmetic updating. We will be back for sure. BW from Rhode Island.",

Upon arrival, our room wasn't quite ready so, we grabbed a couple of drinks in the bar. Imagine our delight when we did get our room and we were upgraded from a regular room to a suite. The room was gorgeous and very, very clean. Our housekeeper Lucia did a super job eveyday and left us towel swans and flowers everyday as well. It was a noce touch that did not go unnoticed.The resort itself is just gorgeous and very clean. It was nice to have access to the other Riu's as well. The beach is beautiful and clean. One day when we were walking on the beach, we saw a local up at the top of a 50 foot palm tree getting coconuts. It was pretty cool to see...once in a lifetime kind of thing.The staff at the Riu Taino is amazing , pleasant and try very hard to help. Despite reviews I read before I left, they're English is not as bad as other reviews say...be patient...they are listening to many different languages day in and day out.The food is plentiful and very tasty. I ate just about everything. I had a bit of upset stomach one day but, my boyfriend was fine the whole time.All in all, we had a great vacation and I would recommend the Riu Taino for anyone's vacation!!! Have Fun!!!!!",

Grounds were absolutely lovely I for one am a very picky eater cannot eat fish allergic reaction shellfish actually but there was a abundance of choices every night,ranging from chicken to beef to pork and pasta no shortage of options for the picky!! Beach was incredible just how I remembered it way back in 1987 just like paradise Animation staff very outgoing and friendly always with a smile on their face and a willing Hola!  Loved it so much that we went back the following year in February and got engaged proposed to her on the beach on Valentines day,reception was great settting everything up decorating the room with ballons etc.  Went to Paridisus Playa Conchal this past February a little more refined more dining options but basically the same quality food but for the price I would recommend Riu Taino,fiancee and I did not know we found a diamond in the ruff !!!  Going back in April of 2005 look for the guy at the pool bar with the 64 oz Tim Horton's mug!!!",

Everything at that hotel is about the guest. The workers are friendlier than ever and are at your ever need. Dont be scared, you will make a lot of friends. The pool, and ocean are beautiful. This resort is along side 4 other of it's sister resorts and you can travel freely from each. There are 5 shows at any givin night to attend. The shows are really good, and funny and beautiful. There is deffinatly a show for every single person. They have amazing water sports. Not a lot of places include everything, but they really do, and whatever they dont include, you can buy it for very cheap. Every night a bazaar comes to one of the 5 resorts and you can hagal items for just about any price. I think there were 2 or 3 resteraunts to attend but my party didn't even go to one because we were perfectly happy with the buffets, filling everyone's needs. I truely recomend this vacation for everyone. Everyone will love it!",

        "content": "Wonderful Trip I just got back from the Riu Taino two days ago and the person who wrote from Pittsburgh, PA who wrote on April 27th review was right on the money. Print that review out and take it with you if you plan on going.I went with my girlfriend and my parents and we had an absolutly wonderful time. The staff is amazing. They are so energetic and fun to be around. During the day they have all kinds of activities that include, aerobics on the beach, water polo, soccer on the beach, ping-pong tournament, dance lessons by the pool, water aerobics, etc. etc. etc.The food was very good for the most part. There were plenty of choices. The two a-la-carte restaurants were average. I found the food better at the buffet restaurant in the hotel.The beach is simply beautiful and there is incredible snorkling right off the beach where we saw many specicies of exotic fish and a octopus. There were a lot of Europeans and many women went topless.Yes. I did get sick. But that was because I accidently used the hotel water to brush my teeth and because I drank a lot of booze the entire trip. However, if you are careful, this can be avoided.My impression of the Riu Taino was that it was a younger more fun Riu out of the Riu hotels in Punta Cana. There were a lot of younger couples, and honeymooners. Also, it is very close to the beach. Whereas other Riu hotels were set back further from the beach. It is also next to Caribbean Street that has a bunch of stores and the Pachu Disco as well as the Casino that is part of the Riu Palace.Rooms. The rooms were nice and clean. Nothing fancy. I travel a lot for work and I thought the rooms were great.I would definately go back to Punta Cana and if you are doing your research, I would strongly recommend the Riu Taino.",

        "content": "I stayed here for two weeks and base my review on the aggregate visit and observations of both properties. First, know that there are two locations for Vantaggio Suites in San Diego: the State Street property, which is like a very run down and poorly managed combination of youth hostel and frat house, and the Broadway Street property, which is comprised of several individually-owned units thrown into the Vantaggio Suites rental pool. It seemed like a poor rendition of a time-share situation; however, there was no effective management or oversight to speak of and there would certainly not be any takers were this a \"real\" time share property. Pros: State Street property is right on the edge of Little Italy in downtown San Diego, directly across the street from Amici Park. There is easy I-5 freeway access, and plenty of Italian restaurants and shops easily within walking distance of less than a block. And with a short walk toward the San Diego bay, this place has got location, location, location (but no parking!). There are common areas like you would find in a frat house as well as a laundry room. It is a highly international clientele, with Japanese advertisements and postings all over the place. Broadway Avenue property is further east from San Diego, located on Broadway between 26th and 27th Streets past the East Village area. It's a fairly residential area but is quite unsafe in the evenings. There are bars on the windows and a gated entrance and gated garage (which is included in the room price). The area is very Hispanic, and there are a few Mexican restaurants within walking distance (but I'd recommend only do this during daylight hours). There's a fire station within a block, so expect to hear lots of sirens. Rooms come with balconies and kitchen facilities, complete with full-sized fridge, microwave, dishwasher, stove. There is unlimited wired internet access. There is a small TV, about the size of a 17\" computer flat screen. Cons: First let me say that I am jaded about this place and would absolutely NOT recommend it to anyone. This is due to the fact that I had two \"accidents\" on the property and sustained injuries and bruises, and I gave up trying to assign responsibility for the poor condition of not only the elevator but the emergency and stairwell access. The elevator broke, with me in it, and dropped a floor very quickly. I was thrown to the floor injuring my back and left side/hip/leg. To add insult to injury, neither the alarm nor the doors worked so I was trapped inside. Calls to the management office were futile and they declined knowledge or responsibility to the property, so I called 911. The firemen had me out in about 20 minutes; however, they could not find the stairs (because the stairs were unmarked, and they are also inaccessible from outside the stairwell meaning that you can get out but you can't get in). We had to walk completely around the block (on my injured hip and leg and back, no less) in order to get into the complex. Anyway, to make a horrible story shorter, Vantaggio Suites management and employees, NNJaescke Property Management and employees, and the owner of the actual unit all pointed to each other and the State of California for responsibility for the malfunctioning elevator and my injuries. By the end of my stay there, I felt like it was my own fault. Other cons for Vantaggio Suites at Broadway: - Filthy dirty. Old, ragged carpet that was not only frayed but was a trip hazard. - Old dirty curtains. When you pulled the fabric curtains opened, you held your breath that the curtain rod would not collapse, and you literally had to unstick your hand from the dirty fabric. - Damaged screens with holes. Place was so dirty that there were spider webs (inside!) and bugs flying in and out. With no air circulation, no fan, and no air conditioning, and weather in the 100 degree range, I had no choice but to leave the windows opened. - Murphy bed. It was down when I arrived, which was a good thing because I could not get it to raise or go back into the wall. - Stinks! This place smells like old garbage. Though it is getting a facelift, repainting, and fixing the front courtyard area, it is still a very old building that resembles a converted flop house or homeless shelter. - Dishes and utensils provided were well used and dirty. Though there was a dishwasher, apparently the previous occupant had not used it and nobody checked (or they checked but did not care). Dishes were past spotty ... they had grime on them. I promptly threw every dish and pan I could find into the dishwasher and ran them myself. - Plastic utensils (spoon, spatula) they had provided were melted in half and unusable, so I took them to the front desk where they promptly laughed me out of the office. I ended up purchasing my own set and taking them with me. - Combo tub and shower were in a decent sized bathroom area. However, it was a very old metal tub (read: slippery). Because of a fall, I ended up purchasing my own bath mat. - Old construction! This means that the walls are thin, and the permanent apartment residents do have their own TVs and stereos that echo around the complex. It's shaped in a square with the courtyard in the middle, so the noise bounces inside the place. Also, the couple on the 4th floor (the top floor) had hardwood floors and sounded like the walked everywhere with tap shoes on. - Remember that this operates much like a time share, so you do not have cleaning service. If you desire, they can schedule once per week refreshment/upkeep cleaning, for $150 per month. I would have run screaming in another direction within 10 minutes of arriving there and gone to another property if given the choice. However, the entire stay would have been non-refundable. When I voiced my concerns to the management at the front desk, the response was \"you can leave whenever you want, but there's no way we're giving you back any money.\" You have been warned ... I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!",

As per the review below do not bother talking with desk clerk 'Parvez' if you can avoid him then do so.... i believe he mainly works the night shift so is generally there if you are checking in at night or early in the morning. His answer to everything is very unhelpful, always a no, and when finding out about excursions he always quoted 100 dirhams more then other staff, there is free internet available to use for staying guests and he even tried to charge for using that! Apart from him, we had a fabulous holiday, everything about these apartments were lovely, very modern, nice big bedrooms/beds, very clean bathrooms, nice kitchen. They also have a lovely rooftop swimming pool to cool of in the heat and a very new Gym. Apartments are in a good location too about a 10/15 minute walk to al karama/bur juman metro. Very good selection of restaurants nearby. Would not hesitate to go back.",

        "content": "The locations of the Casa Camper hotels both in Berlin and Barcelona are great. I knew the Barcelona one, and trusted that they would choose an equally good location for their Berlin facility. So, since this was my first trip to Berlin, I trusted them. And I am glad I did. The hotel has really large rooms, very clean, an actual clean, fitness facility downstairs with apples, towels and a meditation room included. (treadmill, eliptical, modern weighted pull system (dont know the correct term), mats, mirrors) The roof is outfitted with a business area- and a wonderful floor to ceiling room where guests have breakfast, but can hang out whenever they like, 24 hours. There is food available all the time, with swanky smoothies and greek salads in glass jars...very green of them, and very appreciated. You can eat it upstairs or bring it to your room. They also have a bar set up where it is a trust system- you fill out a little form then take the kind of wine or other libation you desire. (there is a charge for that, but not for the food). This all means that there isn't a refrigerator in the room, which was fine with me. I have terrible allergies and the staff went to great lengths to look up the ingredients of the many breads they had available, printed it out and translated it all for me. One of the other reviews mentioned the lack of fresh air. This is true, it is impossible to open a window and it was rather frustrating. But the trade off is really a great value and a great experience.",

And I've been to a dozen different countries, stayed at Marriotts and Intercontinentals etc. I think that's high praise and the Casa Camper deserves all of it. My room was very large, especially the bathroom area. I think all of the \"corner\" rooms are a liitle bigger than the others (which are still quite big) and have big bathtubs plus large showers. Everything was clean and modern. All of the staff were friendly. The location is very good. It's a short walk to the Museum Island and a lot of other sites of interest as well. On top of that, the hotel is actually right on top of a U-bahn station. The station entrance is no more than 20 meters from the hotel door. The line (U8) doesn't take you anywhere interesting really but it's easy to change lines at Alexanderplatz. In-room Wi-Fi was perfect. There are two Macs and a printer to use on the top floor. The best and most distinguishing feature of this hotel is the Tentiempie: the top floor restaurant area with great views. Breakfast is very good and served until 11am on weekdays, until 2pm on weekends. To top it off you can go there for snacks anytime you want by yourself - or just take something away to your room. There are croissants, fresh fruit, crisps, coffee and tea, a fridge full of sodas, juices and bottled water etc. etc. - all for free. The top floor area also has a self-service bar that works on the honor system. So you could mix yourself a drink, just how you like it. A/C worked great even though the temperatures were over 30C most of the time. I highly recommend the Casa Camper for anyone visiting Berlin.",

        "content": "Not the greatest place, but still had a good time! We stayed at Natura Park from Dec 4- 11/08. We paid $1950 for 2 people. All inclusive of course. We have previously been to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic and Varadero, Cuba. We flew with Air Transat and both flights were uneventful.... this time we paid more for the extra leg room which is a MUST - definitely worth it! I would not recommend Natura Park to anyone if they asked me if they should stay there. We had very good service at the front desk, they were always attentive. The grounds are very beautiful and well taken care of. Lots of ponds, bridges, flamingos, geese, ducks and BATS at night (EWWW) The beach was amazing of course (though there was a lot more seaweed here than any of the other places we've been). The open beach to the left of the resort is very nice - secluded and nice for walking. No problems finding loungers on the beach, by the pool is a bit more difficult. The food was ok - not the greatest but we never went hungry. We mainly ate at the buffet which always had a good variety of food (pasta, stirfry, omelets, etc). The seafood restaurant was horrible - the food was undercooked and they did not even have lobster. We ended up walking out and going to the buffet instead. The steakhouse was really good, no complaints there. We did not try the Italian restaurant but heard the buffet was better. These a la carte restaurants book up fast so get your reservations in as soon as you get there. All of the bars are quite good. It seems that none of the bartenders can make the same drink though - haha - you ask for something and they will each make you a different one! The male bartender at the bar by the steakhouse made a really good strawberry daquiri (he was usually there at 6:30PM until closing). The nightly entertainment was usually very good (Michael Jackson impersonator, karaoke, dancing, etc).The rooms were something else - and not in a good way. The maids did a good job, though sometimes they take your towels at like 8 AM and you do not get fresh ones unitl 4PM..... The room appeared to be ok - a bit outdated but we are used to that from places before. Our room (# 3230 in building 12) had a major wiring problem and even though someone came to fix it twice, we had no bathroom light for 4 days. Plus we found a huge mouse in our room one night, chased it out, and looked around to find that our ceiling air conditioner had a huge nest in it..... we've never had problems like that before. The power went out quite a bit too, usually in the early evening, but did not last too long.We did the tropical storm excursion for $89 USD per person which is going out on a catamaran for the day. You leave around 8AM and return around 4PM. This was a really fun day! You get to go cruising around the ocean and go by a shipwreck just off Bavaro beach, crash through some monster waves (and got soaked!!), go snorkeling in the reef, have lunch, lots of drinks, and go to the natural pool. I would go on this one again, should we ever return to Punta Cana.We also did the monster truck tour for $90 USD per person which we really liked as well. Our tour guide Gregory made this trip a lot of fun! You drive through the countryside (with drinks of course) and stop at a typical Dominican farm where you try fresh fruits and other products, then you go to a cock fight (which I did not watch - poor things), then you stop at a Dominican school (take supplies for the kids). Then stop for lunch at the river (pretty good food). The final stop is at a Haitian voodoo village. This was disappointing as I thought we'd get to see some voodoo, no such luck. You just walk through the little hut and check out the wierd stuff inside. You leave around 7:30AM and get back around 5:30PMWe visited Manati Park when we were there ($15 USD per person.) Totally not worth it. It is like a really crappy zoo and we saw some guy hitting a parrot there who wasn't performing properly in their little entertainment gig .... I'm totally anti-animal cruelty so that was really hard to see. Don't bother visiting the mall ... there are a lot of stores but they are all quite expensive. The shuttle is free from most hotels - it drops you off and then leaves you there for like 2 hours - it will take you about 1/2 hr to walk through the mall and then you'll sit there and wait for the rest. There is a market close to Natura Park. You can find some good stuff but they really try to rip you off. The general rule is when they give you a price drop it down to half of what you are actually wiling to pay and go from there. Most of the time you end up getting a pretty good deal. You do have to walk out of the resort to get to the market and we were a bit wary at first because you have to walk through some new development and there are a lot of onlookers but every went ok - we walked there twice. The shop in the resort is also ok - but more expensive than the markets of course.I don't think I missed anything.... if you have any questions feel free to ask!",

        "content": "Hmmmm ... We were placed here for one night by the tour operator after our flight home was delayed for 24 hours due to a tropical storm (the resort we'd been staying at for the previous 14 nights was full so we had to move). Reception was chaos with lots of other travellers in the same boat, but the receptionists coped well and got us checked in fairly quickly. The rooms were very basic for a resort purporting to be 5*. Perhaps I'm being a little unfair - they were clean but extremely tired and dated looking, however, especially having been in a brand new modern resort for the previous 2 weeks. However, the grounds were great with loads of palm trees, birds like flamingos and herons, running around the place. The pool is too small for the number of guests. The beach area is very good with plenty of beds, shade, and inclusive watersports. The main public areas like reception, the bar and the restaurants are not air-conditioned and in the tropics this is a problem. Overall, it was fine for an emergency one-night stop, but there are far better, more modern resorts close by.",

My opinion is has follows:,the beach was great ,weather was perfect, the food was ok. Most of the staff were very nice,front desk was much to be desired. The room on the other hand was a nightmare.The pictures of the room are not what they appear to be.There was no air conditioning ,our TV didn't work,called front desk for service aleast 4 times for towel's  water  to fix the TV .I was always told they would send someone , but no one ever showed up. On our departure the TV was still not fixed (2DAYS)when they said they would send someone to fix it. If I was to return it would not be at Natura PARK. My family and I were on vacation to relax and enjoy our time together which we did during the day,but at night returning to our rooms was very upsetting. In my opinion this was not a relaxing vacation. Time  money not spent very well.",

        "content": "Money well spent We booked an all inclusive week at the Natura Park Eco Resort with some doubt as we have had some not so good experiences in the past at other resorts.The price seemed too good to be true but we couldn't pass it up. We did some research about the resort including this website and had mixed feelings about we read but decided to try it anyway, what the $@!#%, it was cheap enough.We arrived at the resort around 10:00 pm on March 30th and were very impressed with the reception that we received. We were into our room within a half hour with drinks at hand. We had requested a room with a king size bed but to our disapointment, we ended up with 2 double beds. So, we went back to the front desk to see if this could be changed. They were quite full that night but said for us to go back in the morning and they would see if they could accomadate us. By 2 pm the following afternoon, we were in our new room with a king size bed and that was the worst part of our whole trip.The food was good (I'm not so fussy but my wife is a bit more selective and she was very impressed with all the selections they had) specially the pasta counter. The service was exceptional and deserved to be complimented specially Rapha毛l at the bar above the pool bar, Anthony at the La Perla Restaurant for the lunch buffet and Sandro/Jos茅 at the Mirgenta Bar along with everyone else on the resort...........too many names to mention them all or to remember.The entertainment was a mixture of professional and audience participation shows, some nights were better than others. The professional shows were really well orchastrated and very well performed.The weather was 70/30 but on the so so days, we went for a walk (about 20 minutes) to the local market which was very challenging (who doesn't like a challenge every once in a while), it was fun bartering for the best price.The beaches were very beautiful with their turquoise water and white sands. The water was warm almost like bath water and the scenery was good too. You could walk for miles and miles all day long if you wanted. There was a bit of seaweed but there was someone raking it up every morning. There was lots to do, kayaking, peddle boats, wind surfing, snorkeling and last but not least, you could drink all you wanted anywhere, anytime.The resort itself was very clean and very well maintained. The vegetation was beautiful with lots of different greenery. It also had different types of birds roaming free (pink flamingos, ducks, geese and other species). They even provided the bread to feed the fish, birds and turtles which made for a relaxing morning.One night, we even walked down to the Casino at the next resort and, much to our surprise, we actually made a little bit of money ($24.00 American dollars). It was worth the 10 minute walk.All in all, after being to a resort in Mexico that was rated a 4 1/2 star and a lot more expensive (which we wouldn't recommend to anyone that we know), our vacation to Natura Park Eco was very satisfying. We are looking forward to going back with friends.PS: We met a lot of people from Canada whom we'll never forget.",

        "content": "Beautiful looking, but hit or miss on everything else Just arrived back from a Sunquest vacation to the Blau Natura Park. It is hard to give an overall impression of the hotel as some things were great, while others poor. The hotel is a short 20 minute drive from the airport (nice looking airport, but the staff will try to extort as much money from you as they can...). It really is in the middle of nowhere, and the area is not pleasant smelling once you get off the resort property.The property itself is quite nice, more natural looking than most - with the exception of the fish ponds/lagoons that are very clearly artificial. It is fun to see and feed the fish and birds that are all over the place. The buildings incorporate a lot of natural materials, which give it a more rustic feel. The beach is a decent size, but there is a lot of seaweed. This is mainly due to the strong winds (which actually help keep you comfortable during the day).The rooms were a disappointment. Everything in them smells musty, and we had little ants of some kind in the bathroom and on the desk. Thankfully, they didn't get into our stuff. The beds were harder than any futon I've ever slept on, and I had a sore neck all week as a result. The electricity is definitely an issue - some of the lights didn't work, and a surge blew out my battery charger. We did have hot water and the A/C worked well, so we were lucky compared to some. Don't travel with anyone you might be shy around, as the bathroom doors are made of slotted wood, and only slide back and forth. Note that noise carries pretty easily, especially near the theatre.The food was hit or miss. Generally, when the meat was cooked properly, it was quite flavourful. The pasta was generally okay. There were issues with keeping food hot though, and both me and my friend ended up with intestinal problems (and when they say don't drink the water from the taps, this includes brushing your teeth!). The a la carte restaurants weren't anything special. Service varied wildly depending on who you had, although the people at the bars were quite nice. Considering the variety of countries that they draw visitors from, I was impressed that most staff could converse in English, French, Spanish or German. The entertainment staff tried, but some of the shows were a litlle slow. Excellent dancers though.The prices at the hotel store were decent (good selection if you forgot anything), but you could get better if you haggled well with the merchants that came on site a few times a week. Don't accept their first or second offers though! They do get a bit annoying though as every one of them wants you to stop and look at their stuff. None of it is really original, as you can get the same items elsewhere on the island if you go into town or on a tour. Do take a tour though, as it will give you a better idea of the island outside of the hotel.  I am glad I went, but I wouldn't go back to this hotel again.",

The grounds are nice and kept tidy. The hotel itself is tired. We were supposed to have a king bed and ended up with 2 3/4 beds. The beach could be very nice but has a lot of seaweed and it seems to be the only hotel along that strip that doesn't clean it up. They seem understaffed and understocked. Towels are often not available and if you need a spoon, you'll likely be going on a treasure hunt. Seats on the beach are also difficult to find. If you'd like wine with your dinner, no problem. If you want a beer, you may have to ask about 3 different servers. You still may not get one, and they don't seem overly concerned. The food is ok, although I think it could be kept warmer. The steak house restaurant is very good. We managed to eat there twice. This restaurant is also off of the beaten track of Punta Cana. Outside the main gates is filthy and the local market is nothing short of harassment. My advice - go somewhere else!",

The grounds are outstanding; multiple different natural pools with different birds (flamingos, herons, peacocks, etc.)The food was less than superb but better than average. The buffet was better than the specialty restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and outgoing. There were minor problems but that must be expected in high season. The tours offered were very good. I particularly enjoyed the Outback Tour. Apple arranged golf outings to Punta Blanca and Punta Cana; both were excellent courses; well worth the money.The comments about the limited beach chairs are correct. After getting skunked two days in a row I learned to play the game and got a towel and claimed a chair as soon as I got up before eating breakfast.I recommend Natura Park to all but the most finicky traveler.",

        "content": "Natura Park - vacation from $@!#%! Natura Park ReviewWe (my husband, my 6 year old son and I) stayed at the Natura Park Resort from May 26th, 2007 to June 2nd, 2007.We have traveled to Punta Cana several times before, and it is safe to say 鈥?this was the worst vacation ever!!!!!!Here is our opinion of the resort and the (non-existing) customer service:Grounds: Beautiful landscape with lush greenery, lagoons, fish, flamingoes and, among other wild life, a bunch of geese. One of them, a large white male goose, viciously attacked my 6 year old son on the first day of our stay when we attempted to pass him on one of the walkways. The bird picked him so hard that he broke the skin in several places. Please do imagine the shock the child was under, since the bird, when aggravated and flapping his wings, was as tall as he was. Needless to say, I brought this unfortunate incident to the attention of the lady at the guest service desk 鈥?her response to me (in very broken English) was: This is an ECO Resort 鈥?Deal with it! I also voiced my complaint about the bird to the Apple Representative, who was told that the bird was very territorial and that management was aware that all vacationers as well as the staff were afraid of it. The only people capable of dealing with the animal were the ground keepers, since they had rakes, shovels etc. the defend themselves.We watched that bird attack 3 different people one evening within 10 minutes鈥? You tell me 鈥?is that something guests should be faced with as soon as they leave their room? Check In: Fast, again front desk staff spoke very little English.Rooms: Shabby, outdated and, above all, in bad repair. Toilet needed to get fixed sometimes twice daily, bathroom floor flooded, TV needed repair. Again, you need to walk all the way up to the reception to ask for maintenance, since if you try to phone the front desk or guest service, their English skills are not adequate to carry on a conversation.Pool: Dirty, even first thing in the morning.Food in the main Buffet Restaurant:Let me start by saying that we are animal lovers 鈥?but having birds sit in the scrambled eggs (and eating from it, of course) in the morning and subsequently walking through all the food platters is disgusting and definitely not improving anyone鈥檚 health. No wonder people were getting sick left and right. The food should have been covered up or one of the many staff members, just standing around involved in personal conversations could have chased the birds away.The food was tasteless, every day with no variety. They were also not very imaginative when it came to use up the leftovers from the day before. YUK. A la Carte Restaurants:First, they were just open one at the time, so if you were in the mood for seafood on Monday, you were out of luck since Monday the Steak House was open. Media Luna Restaurant (Steak House):We had a reservation for 6:30 PM and when we arrived on time, the wait staff was still setting up. They seated us, but didn鈥檛 even asked us if we wanted something to drink 鈥?never mind a menu 鈥?until well after 7:00 PM. When someone finally came to take our order, we asked for 2 beers and a 7-Up for our son. Not too difficult, one should think. We tried to order the Rib eye steak, which was not available that night and then settled for a Filet Mignon with mushrooms. Instead of mushrooms, the filet came buried under a mountain of onions 鈥?without any explanation. When after the meal we still hadn鈥檛 received our drinks (even though we had reminded the waiter repeatedly, we just got up and left. Staff is grossly incompetent.La Perla Restaurant (Snack bar during the day and seafood restaurant at night):Same incompetent wait staff from Media Luna the day before. Lobster was according to the waitress not in season so I ordered Shrimp pasta, which was the same pasta that is available at lunch with 3 shrimp on top. Very disappointing. My husband ordered the filet of sole, which was served under some saut茅ed veggies in aluminum foil. Lots of veggies 鈥?very little fish.Pasta Restaurant:We didn鈥檛 go since we anticipated the same lousy service and tasteless food.Entertainment: Nowhere to be found. No live music and the shows were marginal at best.Animacion: There were about 6 very disinterested people that gave us the impression they were just waiting for their shift to be over. Not much happening.Kids Club:This was the worst 鈥?we had picked this hotel since Apple vacations advertised a kid鈥檚 club from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.On our first day, I tried to take my son to the club and no employee showed up until 10:30 AM. I ended up leaving him at the kids club with a rather bored looking member of the animation team, who parked him in front of a TV and proceeded to put her feet up on a table and enjoy her book. To make matters worse, while sitting at the pool bar 鈥?we saw our son happily swimming towards us in the pool. Apparently, the girl didn鈥檛 understand she was to supervise the child until we would get back. Also, she informed us that the kid鈥檚 club was about to close for lunch from noon to 3:00PM!!!!!!!!!When I addressed the issue with the guest service clerk, I was again faced with an employee that spoke very little English and cared even less.So, if you have a child, stay far, far away from the Natura Park Hotel.Management:We tried to speak to the General Manager one evening about our concerns (that day that the toilet was still not working after they fixed it twice that day and the bathroom floor was flooded, we were told that it was dinner time and the manager was in the restaurant eating. We asked the front desk clerk to please call him and asked him to speak to us. The clerk even went downstairs to inform the GM, but no response. I was contacted the next day by guest services to make an appointment to finally speak with the GM 鈥?which I did. The appointment was set for 6:00 PM and when I got there (on time, of course) the GM was nowhere in sight. I was informed that he was on his way to the hotel and had car problems. Right! As we found out later, he used the same excuse for other unhappy guests that tried to speak with him.All in all, you can鈥檛 blame the staff for the less than marginal service 鈥?if management doesn鈥檛 care, why should they!This was by far our worst vacation ever 鈥?we will definitely never go back to the Natura Park Hotel.",

Pleasant service, beautiful lay out, clean rooms, all greatly appreciated after a long day of travelling. Like others, we were pleased to see how wrong some of the previous bad reviews were. This was one of the nicest family resorts I've been too..and believe me, I've been to one not so nice...not half as nice as Natura. Would definitely go back. Beach was beautiful, pool was small but was perfect for us with the children - never out of our sight. Entertainment and activities for all...nightly shows were a bit cheesy but fine....can't comment on what happened past the shows as we were in the sack and up early for another beautiful day at the beach (or pool). Food was fine too...plenty to choose from especially for the kids who are normally picky eaters. Now on to the bad...stay away from Sun Wing!!!!! Should've known we'd be getting terrible service right from the start when our flight times were changed 2 times before we even left Hfx. On the way back home on Apr. 7th, we were re-routed due to a snow storm, from Hfx to Moncton..once there, we were left on our own to fend for ourselves...sat in the airport from 8:30 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. the next day, then demanded to be put up in a hotel like the hundreds of other re-routed passengers who were smart enough to go with another airline....Sun Wing had no one contact us, couldn't be reached in any way possible. By 3:00 a.m., we had airport staff track someone down (in Toronto).... were making offers that were ridiculous i.e. find your own way back to Hfx if you didn't want to drive back to Hfx in a snow storm in 4 clunky school buses (which never did arrive at the airport like we were told by the way) ....absolutely absurd..meanwhile, lucky travellers from other co's were flown back to Hfx by 9:00 a.m. the next day. Sun Wing rep. was finally contacted by phone from the hotel the next day - no help at all.....we found him with the help of a fellow passenger and the hotel front desk clerk but by then (after 11:00 a.m.) because we were all exhausted and told there were no other accommodations to be made, we climbed aboard...thank goodness we had great bus drivers ...trust me when I say once again (with support from appx. 70 other people)...stay away from Sun Wing!!!!!! There are plenty more details of the horrible service but not enough space here to write....stay away from Sun Wing!!!!!! It was the worse possible way to end an excellent vacation at Natura...I'll definitely go back to Natura but next time it won't be with Sun Wing.Take your family and enjoy the wildlife roaming the walkways...it'll be a great time!Debbie from NS",

        "content": "Where you DON'T go for a vacation!!! This horrible experience began with a simple idea for a group of 8 friends to share a vacation in the Caribbean. We initially made our own reservations for a weekend stay at the resort and made multiple calls both before the trip, upon arrival to the country and again the day before we drove to the resort. The hotel staff confirmed our reservations each instance we called. Not until we arrived at the hotel early in the afternoon did we find out the staff there had LIED to us!!! They had given, yes given away our rooms which were reserved months ahead of time, to a tour group!!!! Even as we repeated our claims time and time again to staff at the reservation desk we were ignored and at one instance even told to shut up. They would not even give us the opportunity to speak to a manager, who according to them was not at the hotel that day. Finally after over an hour they found an assistant manager who admitted they lied to us each time we called to confirm. As we waited for the manager we saw multiple guests of the hotel approach the counter with their own complaints. They ranged from bugs in their rooms to bathrooms that didn't work and the staff did little to accommodate them. This experience left a nasty taste in our mouth the rest of the time there. In the end we were sent to another resort and no restitution for the lost day and aggravation. To sum up the staff are rude and unapologitic aswell as liers, and from the sounds of it the facilities are deteriorating. Don't bother going! You'll risk your piece of mind for a relaxing vacation.",

        "content": "Not so bad. My wife and I just got back from Natura and had a GOOD time. We are both in our mid thirties and we found the resort to be nice. The food is decent and the weather is awesome. the landscaping is beautiful and our roome was mostly clean. If you have never been there are some things you might want to know about this place:1. Mini bar has only two beers and two Pepsi's. Good luck getting them refilled quickly.2. If your looking for a lounge chair by the pool to kick up your feet and relax, you better get up before 6am and take you towel out to the pool and claim your territory. If you don't, I hope you like concrete?3. Do not go to the Palma Real mall. Of the 33 stores claimed to be in operation, 12 were true to their word.4. Kirby at Conquest tours was absolutely useless. He showed three hours late for orientation and blamed us for the mistake. On this note get use to time deadlines not being made by employees.5. Bring plenty of American cash. They told us if we wanted more we could easily get it from the front desk. Take a wild guess what happened?6. The a la carte restaurants were nice, but we had difficulty getting reservations-even after orientatiion! Nothing a little cash couldn't solve. Amazing there were no spots left until Mr. LIncoln came out.7.",

        "content": "Great vacation in the Sun We stayed at Natura Park Jan 11-18, 2007 and we had a great time. There is always something to complain about if you want to, but it was definitely a nice resort.We travelled with another family and had 4 children between us (ages 5, 7, 9 11). The kids were feeling a bit too old for the Kids Club but did participate in the Mini Disco show when they could. Petra was nice and did invite the kids to the club. Jimy encouraged the kids to participate in daily activities at the pool and on the beach. He was very friendly. They had sand toys and games by the pool - shuffleboard, mini-golf, bean bag toss etc.The beach did have seaweed. What built up over the day was collected each morning, so it wasn't horrible. There seemed to be more build up on the hotels next door (Allegro, Punta Cana Grand). We spent most of our time at the pool - though the older kids did some snorkelling. It was windy - so the ocean was wavy but the breeze was nice. It did bring in some clouds - and sunshowers, but really only lasted a minute or two.The rooms were average and we got good maid service. We did not use anything in the Mini Bar because we didn't need to. We had plenty of towels, soap etc. We got lots of water in big bottles every day.Don't buy from the vendors (sharks) that come on to the resort. They wear pink/peach shirts and hound you if you are around the pool. You can get much better deals at the hotel gift shop or if you feel like bargaining there is a market down the beach at the Punta Cana Grand (to the right). But beware, they will all want you to visit their shop for the cheapie, cheapie deals. Just be prepared to haggle or say no. We ate at all the restaurants -including the beach grill and none of us got sick. We liked the smoothie bar at the main buffet. But there was always a wait.The resort was getting busier as our week progressed and we did have to line up for lunch at the main buffet one day (I think they weren't able to clean up tables fast enough) and the pool restaurant was more crowded. But really what is the rush if you are on vacation?DO NOT change any money into Dominican Pesos. Everywhere takes US dollars and you can't change the Pesos back to any other currency. DO NOT take the bus to the Palma Real shopping center. It took over 40 minutes with all the stops at other hotels and there were only 4 stores open. It will be nice when it is done, but give it another year or so.DO take a bun and feed the turtles at the bridge at the front entrance. It is a hoot to watch the turtles, ducks and fish fight for the food. They all seem to come out of nowhere.DO take the country adventure/safari trip. We went with County Adventures - there are lots of tour companies that do it. You get to see a Dominican home, a school, a sugar plantation, a coffee/cocoa ranch, have a horsback ride and boogie board at a beautiful beach. (And the requisite stop at a tourist gift shop - with items made in China). The kids really learned a lot about how easy they have it. Also we took some school supplies to leave at the school (pens, pencils, erasers, crayons, notebooks etc). Enough said. Enjoy the quietness of the resort. There are no other attractions (other than a Casino) around, so you will relax. Take sunscreen and bug spray (we did have mosquitos at the Italian a la carte one night - but otherwise none).",

        "content": "It must be a terrible place to work! Stayed there from Dec 26/06 to Jan 2/07. I have been to Punta Cana once before at an excellent resort, and my wife has been to several resorts in Punta Cana and Puerto Plata, as well as Acapulco, Mexico, etc. I regret that there is a lot of negativity in this review, I still had a great time in spite of the resort (thanks to the weather, the beautiful beach and my 16-mo. old daughter's laughter).First the good stuff:I liked the rooms, the resort grounds are beautiful, the food at the steakhouse was very good and the New Year's Eve dinner was also very good. None of us got sick, although my daughter had a mild bout of diarrhea before we switched her to rice, pasta, water, bananas and some fruit. The staff was pretty good at raking up the seaweed from the beach, but they missed a day here and there. Weather was fantastic, poured like $@!#% most nights and gorgeous breezy days.But...We had all kinds of negative experiences with the service. The staff at the reception desk lied to us without blinking an eye, first about when the rooms would be ready and again about finding a crib for our daughter. In my opinion, it appears they are trained to tell you whatever you want to hear so you will go away and stop bothering them. While the clerk I was speaking with insisted she never said to come back for our room keys at 2:30, that check-in time is 3, the clerk beside her was having a similar conversation, insisting with a smile that he told my fellow traveller that keys would be ready at 3:30. This made my clerk a little uncomfortable, since they were both telling different stories. Others from our flight (arrived in PC at 10.30am) didn't get their room keys until 5.30pm.On check-in (1pm) we asked a crib for my 16 mo. old daughter. At 8.30pm when we didn't have one yet, I went to the front desk to ask for one, and was told we would have one in 20 minutes. 90 minutes later I went back to the front desk and asked where it was, could we go to housekeeping and find one. The same person behind the desk explained to me that a crib wasn't part of our reservation. I lost it. I realize now that their blank stares were indications that they simply didn't understand what I was asking. Eventually they said they would try and locate one, and the manager (? - could have been anybody since he didn't identify himself) said he would call us in the room to make sure we got one. He never called. An hour later I found one in a hallway and carried it to our room. When we related our frustration to the Sunwing tour rep, he went and talked to the front desk, returned and apologized on the behalf of Natura. He also said they would make it up to us with some sort of detail - a bottle of rum or something. Nada, never heard from them again. All this on our first day.Language barriers abounded; I fully appreciate that Spanish is the native tongue, but keep in mind I wasn't backpacking in the Dominican - this is an all-inclusive and, to some degree, you rely on the staff to make the effort to help you have a good time. I had no such problems at my last resort (Bavaro Princess). Nada from this resort. I did the best I could with Spanish, but when I had to rely on English to try and ask/explain something, I didn't get anywhere with anyone.Bellhops, waiters, bus staff, bartenders, some housekeepers - nobody wanted to do more than the bare minimum. There was even some rudeness. We gave up asking for cutlery/napkins/coffee refills: it was so much easier to wander around La Cana (the main buffet rest.) until you found it yourself. Twice I had to go hunting for towels because the housekeeper forgot us. On one of those occasions, I called the front desk, tried to explain that we had no towels, they said they would take care of it. An hour later a maintenance guy showed up to fix the door. (--?!) Thankfully, he had a key to the housekeeping linen closet and brought us two bath towels. The wind frequently blew debris into the pool from the beach restaurant. As the day went on, I was surprised that no staff came along to clean it up. Paper napkins, bits of food, dirt, etc. accumulated at the two ramps leading into the pool (The ramps are great for toddlers!). The foot-washing showers to remove sand were broken. Lots of sand in the pool. I developed a sinus infection and my daughter a mild eye infection. Hard to say if it was from the pool, but I don't know where else either one of us would have picked it up.A friend we met on the plane to Punta Cana got violently ill - food poisoning - on his last meal before getting on the plane home. Poor guy spent the entire trip locked in the bathroom, paramedics waiting for him at the airport.There are better resorts for the same money. I'm willing to bet there are better resorts for less money. If you are desperate enough to get away and have to go here, then I hope you have no issues on your trip, otherwise you will be challenged to get any help: expect to fall between the cracks. Everyone else that I met (Canadians, French, Polish, Czech, German, Italian) all told the same familiar story. They said they wouldn't go back either. Sunwing will be my last choice for future trips.",

He soon became my fiance... because he proposed to me on the beach on our very first night! The resort is beautiful, full of plants and flowers and wildlife. The beach is beautiful too- I had heard that people were turned off by the seaweed, but there really was very little seaweed in the water. There are maintenance staff who sweep it off the beach- I did not think it was a problem at all. The pool was very clean and very large! We really enjoyed getting pina coladas at the swim-up bar! There are not a lot of kids there, which is something that we wanted. It was 95% adults, very few children. For us, that was a good thing. The food was very good... but it is not americanized at all. So chinese food is not exactly what you're used to... but if you have an open mind, I think you'll enjoy it. We had dinner at all three restaurants, steakhouse, Italian, and seafood- and they were all great! My favorite was the seafood. We had a great week, got very tan, ate good food, enjoyed pina coladas and bahama mamas... relaxed a lot... exactly what we wanted. We took an excursion to the capital of the DR, Santo Domingo, and that was really interesting and fun. It was neat to see the city and the culture of the residents. We really had a great week, and...we liked it so much that we are thinking of going back this fall for our honeymoon! If you are looking for very relaxing, mellow vacation... this is for you. If you want a crazy spring break/nightlife vacation, this would not be it. We loved it, hope you do too!",

The ocean is breath taking and the walk down the beach to the left of the resort is unforgetable. The steakhouse was one of the best meals of my life. Although the other 2 speciality restaurents where medicore, I was not dissappointed with the resort. This country has some of the happiest people going about their busniess, asking Don't you just love our country? When will you come back again???When I try to compare the Dominican to Mexico, The Domincan WINS. I shed a tear as my taxi pulled away from the resort. My only warning to furture travelers is don't eat the lobster, and don't use the mini-bar. If you can afford go on the tours sold by the vacation providers or have fun bartering at the markets!!! I highly recommend the Nurse Shark/Bob Marley tour, it is a very fun filled day",

        "content": "Beautiful Beach If you are planning to go to Punta Cana, Dominican Rep., I can recommend the beautiful resort, Natura Park Eco Resort. In this resort, you can find a beautiful natural environment, wild birds , very quiet and clean rooms, great and friendly people (even though not all staff speak English, however, all of them are willing to make your vacation enjoyable). The beach is beautiful with white sand and you can walk forever. There are no vendors harassing guests on the beach. The water is clear and the beach is well maintained with plenty of lounge chairs. There were the usual resort activities: volleyball, water polo, some meringue lessons.On the other hand, in our experience there are many things that the management could improve and make this a 5 star Resort. For example: If you like alcoholic beverages be prepared to drink a lot because in my opinion the bottles are diluted with something, but I am not sure. Some wine was poured from a large white plastic bleach container!If you purchased all inclusive package you have the right to have a la carte dinners in each of the 3 restaurants, my advice; if you drink wine (red or white) purchase your own at the Duty Free because the Spanish house wine that they serve with the meals is terrible! The food was better than the buffet, but in this resort, food and drink is not the highlight.Talking about the buffet, in my personal opinion, in general its ok. Some of the meals in the buffet were very greasy, and very salty, and the seafood is not great as I expected. We were a little sick after eating seafood but we are not sure if the seafood was the cause. However, be prepared and take a big bottle of Pepto Bismol with you (helps). Another good piece of advice is; bring small bills in American dollars because it is very difficult to change large bills for small ones. Tip your room maid the first day and you will get plenty of water, coffee, beer extra towels and changed linens when you want. There is a spa on site, (extra charge) the mud massage (called fango) was great. 3 clay tennis available. After spending a week in Natura Park, I found our time was enjoyable, we had a good time in a beautiful place, and people were very hospitable. However, I won鈥檛 come back there, I will try another resort in the Caribbean next time.",

I must say that on the whole we had an enjoyable and relaxing holiday.The hotel and the grounds are beautiful and well maintained. It was fun to feed the fish and the birds that are there.The room we had was clean and very comfortable. Our maid kept us supplied with towels, coffee and bottled water. Our minibar was replentished every day with Pepsi and beer and it kept our water cold. We had a nice balcony to sit and have morning coffee or an early evening drink. We did tip our maid and leave some small gifts daily. The only problem we found was before the disco closed they tended to turn up the music for about half an hour. When we asked guest services about this he laughed and said he did not even know they had a disco.The food was good but not great. There was no need for you to go hungry as there is plenty of choice. My wife is a picky eater and she always had something she liked. They do have to make more of an effort to serve food that is hot. This problem was even noticed in the a la carte restaraunts.The service in the restarants is fair to poor. Tipping did not seem to help. At times I felt that when given a tip it embarased them and they would not come back.The bars and bar service was very good. They quickly got to know what you wanted and even with long lines they worked quickly and happily. Tips are appretiated here.All other areas such as activities, beach and pool have been thoroughly covered in previous reviews.Remember you are in the Dominican Republic Do not let the negative things like cold food and slow service in restaurrant ruin you holiday. Relax let it happen.PSTake mosquito repelant and apply it for the evenings.",

Rooms: Well-maintained rooms.Grounds: Excellent grounds, very well kept with plenty of wildlife. Lovely for children to enjoy. Only lacking in benches. Despite all the water bugs were not terry bad as long as one took care at night.Beach: Very large given the hotels size, pleanty of excellent shades. A bit too much boating activity. Food: In general good and very good at the a la carte restaurants. Entertainment: Mediocre entertainment and a very hot poorly ventilated stage area. Health and spa facilities: GoodOverall a great place to relax, but probably not so good if one is looking for entertainment and nightlife.",

        "content": "Fabulous! I had ready all of the reviews I could get my eyes on before we left, and I have to disagree with many, many of the complainers I read about. Yes, there was a bit of seaweed here and there and more on certain days, etc.; however, nothing overwhelming and certainly nothing to stop me from enjoying wading or swimming in the water. The buffet for breakfast and dinner did leave a bit to be desired, but I still managed to pack on some pounds, so there must have been enough to keep my hunger pangs from being outrageous - that and the constant food display down by the pool/beach throughout the day. When we first arrived, our room was not was we requested (not a King bed), but once we found out and told them that's not what we asked for, next thing we knew, we were in our King-bed room.We didn't understand a whole lot of the people around us as we were minority speaking English, and found that to be the perfect thing for relaxing. We knew enough spanish to make our way around, as well as found several other couples who too spoke English if we really felt we needed to rattle off a conversation with someone other than ourselves and the excellent bartenders who were always fun to try and communicate back and forth with (by the way - Jose down at the beach bar is the man you need to see - a little Mamma Wanna each night and you'll be set). The resort is perfectly located down from a shopping area, as well as it offers snorkeling, horse-back riding, parasailing, sun bathing, exercise, sports, and there are reps who offer taking a boat to other places to get dinner and/or do shopping elsewhere. I recommend the Lobster/seafood place (Langosta del Caribe) about 15 minutes down the beach by boat - fabulous food, more shops to see (inside a little community) and all the drinks you can take in while you sit and dine through a several-course, great meal. It even downpoured while we were eating, and the Cana tree awnings provided all the protection we needed - didn't get a drop on us! We brought the wash clothes as recommended in other reviews, but noticed there is one included in the hotel, it's just a little unnoticeable as it's in the basket under the shampoos, comb, etc. they provide for you... so if nobody ever seems to use it, yeah, I imagine people think the hotel doesn't have them. The room itself was cleaned very well, and the maid was excellent to us - leave a dollar next to the bottle of water and she'll bring you more bottles of water than you can even drink the next day.I highly recommend for buying your jewelry or pictures to take a walk down the beach to the left. There is a man that boats in his stuff daily and sells it cheaper than the gift shop and WITHOUT ANY HASSLE!Only thing I would have liked to see in Natura Park resort that wasn't offered is a disco place. I was hoping to dance a little while I was there, but that wasn't an option.I don't have any other experiences to compare it to as it's my first time being there, but I do know that I would return to Natura Park - great place, great people, great time, great sites. Wish I was there now!",

The grounds were clean and well kept and the rooms were fine. However, if you are looking to rest up from a stressful lifestyle this is not the place for you. The nightly bar entertainment was noisy and that was expected. What was not expected was how noisy the hotel was in general. The marble courtyard and thin wall construction made for loud nights and mornings with the other patrons and staff having their conversations bounce off the walls and onto your thin wood door. I got more rest at home working two jobs and exercising 3 times a week. If you sleep late and wake early, then this is place for you.",

I'm pretty fussy about traveling as to where I stay and accomidations and room,etc. This place met all that I wanted except for just one small problem and that I don't speak spanish, but managed to get along and the other problem was the beef. I found their beef very hard to chew and therefore was dissaponited about that only. The food is pleantiful especially the breakfasts, lunch also very good and dinners, well if you stick to chicken and their fish you won't be dissapointed. Go early and watch the sun rise, reserve your chairs and then have breakfast and then enjoy, enjoy , enjoy. The staff are excellent and the spa for a massage or sauna or both is great and the cost is unbeatable. I would suggest an early flight and a late return flight to reap the benefits before leaving. I strongly reccomed it. I would give it 5 stars as a rating...",

        "content": "Extremely Nice Grounds Since i saw some of the reviews of this place i had second thoughts about my up vacation coming up. However i am pleased to say that the hotel gardens and grounds were extremely beutiful. I loved all the flamingoes and geese and wildlife on the resort. The geese seem to attack you and bite you for your food. My family found it quite comical and laughed at the fact of those damn man-eaters that would hang out and bite the people walking by. Ive been down to the carribean as well as Mexico and I thought that the hotel as a whole was well kept and alot of fun. The food is great. Im a picky eater and I still thought the food was better then all the other resorts that ive stayed at. I do have to say the drinks could have been better. THEY dont even put a banana in a banana mama. They seem to have a different method of doing things. The pina coladas were pretty good and your beer and mixes are the same were ever you go. The beach was really great. There are no waves so if you are a surfer and wave rider dont plan this area to ride waves. The waves break out on the reef way out in front of the hotel. The snorkeling could not have been any better. I mean right by the shore there isn't much corel but if you take a boat out for like $10 dollars/person you go to the coral reef and that is absolutely incredable. Bring in a piece of bread and you will have thousands of fish swarming around you of all different colors. The water is as clear aqua blue as can be. People some what complain about the seawead that washes ashore but it is cleaned up every early morning. If you want all you have to do is walk down the beach for like 2 minutes to the nature park and that is nothing but white sand and few if any weeds. Over all i would definatly recommend the resort to people. The service is great these people would bend over backwards for you more then other caribean peoples. The food is great. The water is great. The resort is great.",

After reading previous reviews I felt confident to book for our stay. Our experience with the staff was excellent from the beginning to the end. From arranging transportation, tours and early check in their was nothing the staff could not do and with a smile! Although not in the city center it was convenient to all locations, we enjoyed the nice quiet area that the hotel was located in. The hotel itself was one of the CLEANEST hotels I have ever stayed in. And the staff the Friendliest, the language barrier was no problem and they were so nice and helpful. The breakfast was fantastic with many different choices. If you choose this hotel you will have no regrets. It was a pleasure to stay at the Relais 6, I hope to visit again in the future.",

Take plenty of money as lots of tours only take cash although it did say they would take cards .......we had to go to the bank twice for cash and we only went for 4 days.We did all the usual sights plus the open top bus which we thought was a bit naff , some of the the info coming through the headphones didnt match the sights you were seeing. I found our Hotel on tripadvisor and it was spot on, Great place to stay and just far enough out of the centre to be able to have nice relexing evenings after hectic days in central Rome.",

        "content": "We stayed at Relais 6 for the first night of our tour of Italy in Feb 2011. Prior to beginning our trip, I had second thoughts about staying here as I realized that there wasn't a lot of information available. In fact, the limo driver (a Roman native) who drove us from the airport to the hotel said he'd never heard of Relais 6 before, or even been to the neighborhood. Fortunately, Relais 6 is an excellent hotel and we had a great stay. Its rather low profile meant that there weren't many other guests, allowing us to fully appreciate its tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean interiors. There were plenty of antiques and old knick-knacks, even a small WWII museum. Room: We booked a standard triple room which felt a little cramped (though the size was probably par for Rome) . Bed and HVAC were good. TV was small and had mostly local channels. Service: Front desk staff were polite and efficient though a bit aloof. Other staff were very friendly and accommodating. Location: Relais 6 is located in a quiet residential area. It's the nicest building along the whole street. There's a pizzeria 5 minutes away by foot (which gets packed during weekends) and there're bus stops a couple of minutes away. It took about 20 minutes to get to Termini station by bus. Overall, Relais 6 offered us great value and I would recommend it to fellow travelers, though I'm also keen to keep it as one of Rome's \"hidden gems\".",

Breakfast is charged at 7 dollars a day per person but we were not asked upon check-in, internet access cost $10 a day... you can go across the street for internet usage for a dollar an hrs if I'm not wrong gym and pool are located in 7th storey... lastly thin walls, not for light sleepers.

The gym is not really a gym, its a treadmill (that I couldn't get to work) a fit ball, and an excersize bike, but at least its something! The pool and area is very nice and has a shower to rinse chlorine off. Staff were friendly and the MRT station is about 10 - 15 min walk away. For those who havent been to Singapore, catch an MRT to Orchard Rd and get off there. Find the Hippo Tours and get a ticket. We only had 2 days in Singapore and the Hippo tours was the best $23 ever spent. They take you to the best spots in the city and you can hop on and off where you like. Also includes a cruise section too! What a beautiful city, make sure you see the sights!",

Room was not much bigger than the queen size bed but that was all one person needs. Not much room for leaving cases open but was able to stand it upright at the end of the bed. Kettle and cups and saucers were provided. Wouldnt recommend the instant \"3-in-1\" coffee and tea provided though, but next door there is a small store that sells small jars of coffee. Shampoo,bath gel, hairdryer and towels provided. Flat Screen TV that struggled to get reception on most channels, but there were a couple of good English speaking choices available. My room was at the back and no street noise at all. Shower cubicle IS bathroom, so similar to a number of European hotels I've stayed in, but much cleaner. Loved the late check-out of 1pm as it fitted well with my schedule. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who just wants a modern, clean room and a comfy bed.",

In the drawer of the bedside table are earplugs, in case the street noise is too much when you're sleeping. I didn't have a problem with the noise at all, but it wasn't anything bad (can hear loud trucks from time to time). The only thing that I wish was different were the curtains on the window. They're nice, but they're white, so they don't really block out the light from the outside. I'd prefer dark curtains, but I had a great sleep nonetheless!

There is enough room to do a little work or hang out without feeling claustrophobic. Beautiful linens, nice bath amenities - in short a lot of attention to detail that results in a room that is comfortable and chic. Don't miss the restaurant at Ames - Woodward, especially for excellent cocktails. (make sure you ask how it got its name. We were very entertained by a waiter during a quiet perior with the historic scandal!) I am so comfortable with the level of service that I often put clients there.

The location is unbeatable - right on the Freedom trail, with lots of central locations within easy walking distance. I'd recommend that you ask for a room on an upper floor as the central location means that the streets below are pretty noisy and there were roadworks as well. But we were well away from it in our 11th floor room, which was modern, bright and well laid out. We had a really memorable stay - highly recommended!",

Not only was the room incredible, but also the staff seemed to anticipate our every need in advance. Hats off to the Upper House staff- you are all excellent. The room was impeccable with a large and outrageously comfortable bed, and a large and outrageously impressive bathroom, three huge sofas, an I-pod loaded with music linked to the AV system, and a well-chosen selection of coffee table books- design, fashion and the history of Hong Kong. Forget the minibar- here we had a maxi bar, a fridge full of complimentary drinks (loved the Firefly), an Illy Espresso machine, and jars of cookies, m&m’s, almonds and more. We were also delighted to find full sized “Ren” products in the bathroom. A few drops of the Ren rose oil in the bathtub whilst looking down on Hong Kong twinkling below me- pure heaven. The Upper House is well located within Pacific Place- good shopping and transport, but because we were so comfortable, we deferred and deferred leaving our room reading and playing backgammon instead… We did make it upstairs to Café Gray Deluxe; we had excellent food and wine, and then a drink at the long bar- great views, a great evening! I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend the Upper House to everyone; I am looking back on a stay at an exceptional and wonderful hotel. I really hope to return.",

Excellent location some 50 metres from the entrance to the Pacific Place shopping mall and a short walk through the park to the Peak tram. The entrance is understated and at first glance it could be mistaken as the garage to the adjoining Marriott. Spacious modern rooms with every possible amienety. Large bath / shower area with R E N toiletries supplied. The Michelin 1 star restaurant is located on the 49th floor and has views over the harbour which when enjoying dinner includes the daily 8pm light show. Good selection of well presented delicious food. All the staff were very polite and friendly with those at breakfast in particular going out of their way to make us feel at home and we felt they regarded us as friends rather than customers. A nice touch was the unexpected delivery of champagne and strawberries to our room on our anniversary. If you are looking for a modern hotel in a convenient location providing lovely rooms and quality dining then this is the hotel for you.",

        "content": "I admit to being nervous about staying at Upper House. A self-confessed Four Seasons Hong Kong junkie, I thought that no hotel could ever match its impeccable service, stunning location, unbelievable facilities and F&B. Boy, was I wrong. Upper House just blew me away - exceeded all expectations and then some. I had more OMG moments in this smallish, stunning boutique hotel in the very convenient Pacific Place than I care to remember. Let’s start with reception: nice and discrete ground floor welcome, warm and enthusiastic without being gushy from an impeccably groomed and professional team. It also smelled gorgeous. We were terribly early (7:30am) and not expecting our rooms to be ready. No problem at all, and a suite upgrade to boot! Immediately whisked away for a comfortable in-room check-in, we had our first OMG moment – the jaw-dropping views of HKG harbour. Then we focussed on the room, HUGE barely describes it. Sprawling more like it, and oh so comfortable. More OMG moments followed – the fit-out and interior detailing all extraordinary. Beautiful timbers, impeccable craftsmanship, easy to operate touch-button controls for everything; brilliant lighting, TV and in-built sound system wiring the iPod to all rooms, including bathroom. A minibar with complimentary beer, soft drinks and juices – there is a God! And oh, what a bathroom – two rooms actually, one with twin vanities and TWO inbuilt dressing tables and stools, separate loo and more space than you’ll every use; then into a corridor, up some broad, flat, LED under-lit stairs to the pièce de résistance, the ‘bath’ room. A free-standing, centre-of-room bath surrounded by picture windows with HKG and its harbour spread beneath you. Covetous REN products complemented this spectacular offering. Tucked behind, a large cubicle with rain-shower seemed almost superfluous but equally inviting. It was then off to Café Gray Deluxe for breakfast and service that was so sharp and on-the-ball it almost made you weep with joy. Highly attentive, knowledgeable and thoroughly accommodating, staff could not do enough. You knew they really cared. Needless to say the food was beyond delicious and the coffee, without doubt, the best in town. We returned later for afternoon tea (book through a Virtuoso travel agent and it's complimentary, as was the room upgrade) and the best I’ve ever had – so contemporary, flavoursome and original it puts all the others to shame. Sorry Peninsular, your high-tea is well and truly trumped here. The adjacent bar proved a knock-out venue for cocktails that evening – very pricey but with the level 49 views and supremely comfortable all-window nooks it was incomparable. The interior design and comfort here and in the café brings more OMG moments. No, there is neither pool nor spa at Upper House, only a small but useful gym. No big deal though - I popped 20m across the road to the Shangri-la to do all that. Great facilities and not the least bit inconvenient. And a pool that almost rivals the Four Seasons’. Upper House was one hotel I never wanted to leave. A flask of warm milk and cookies on turndown was a nice touch but the take-away espresso waiting at 5:45am on checkout really sold me. I’ll return to the Four Seasons when I feel like a resort-type stay, but every other time I’ll be back to Upper House. It was like being in the home you might create in your dreams.",

        "content": "In the heart of Pacific Place, lies the Upper House Hotel, being the inaugural Hong Kong Hotel for the Swire group. Just getting to the restaurant is an experience in itself; certainly in the evening the ambiance sets the tone for what’s in store. While modern minimalism is a feature of the Hotel, making ones way up the long sleek escalator with warm teak wood hues gives way to a lift lobby that then takes you to the top floor of the Hotel wherein lies on the 49th Floor Café Gray Deluxe. A short candle lit hall leads to the interior. With the bar and cosy semi private booths on the right and the main dining area straight ahead, the inimitable style and refined aesthetics are both soothing and sophisticated. Service It’s not that hard to build and create a great looking restaurant, however, while one can build and create the most amazing places on earth it takes people to make them a reality. This is where Café Gray Deluxe exceeds expectations. Quality service should always be unobtrusive yet professional and efficient. Café Gray Deluxe is both. More than that, it’s carried out in a genuinely caring manner. Making this a place where casual meets sheik with attention to service. On our visit our service was superb and again proves that in Hong Kong, it is indeed the five star hotels that can attract and retain quality people. Food While there has been “mixed” reports in the media on the food, on our visit we ordered a variety of dishes, all of which were both enticing and delicious. Mixed Oysters with Crab legs (the latter already carefully slice open for easy access) being tastefully presented on a bed of ice, both the Oysters and the Crab were of the freshest and finest. Other dishes to follow where: Pork Chops tenderly cooked with a nice selection of vegetables, a whole Lemon Sole cooked to perfection with a tangy light lemon sauce, and Beef Cheeks, being tender and gelatinous accompanied by a light sauce and medley of vegetables. Now this is were some other reviews had differing thoughts, but my point is this. Good food done well, prepared fresh and with attention to detail is the key to success. It is a simple as that, and while some diners may have different conceptions or follow other fads in reality there is no need for food to be convoluted or complicated. This is where Café Gray Deluxe excels, with quality produce and a traditional approach, neither will never go out of style. Overall it further elevates the dining status for which Hong Kong is famous. Dining at Café Gray Deluxe can be like dining anywhere else in the world and certainly comparable to, Tokyo, London, Paris and New York. No doubt the fact the Chef Gray Kunz, spent sometime at a very successful establishment in New York, evokes a major influence in this dining venue. Personally I can’t wait to go back there!",

Upon checking in, several members of the staff actually made it a point to say Happy Birthday to my husband. Our room was ready right away and we were told we'd been upgraded to a Deluxe Suite! One of the staff members met us at our room to show us around. All I can about the room is WOW! So gorgeous. Everything about the hotel exudes a classy, timeless quality. Our room had a huge terrace with a fantastic view of the city. The bathroom is beyond words. The bed and bedding......heaven! After being in our room about an hour, a member of the staff delivered a handwritten note and a chocolate bar from the General Manager wishing my husband a Happy Birthday. They really do think of everything here! Every member of the staff is so polite and respectful. They have a way of making you feel like you're the only guest. The location is perfect.....just a couple blocks from Michigan Ave., etc. If you're traveling within a 2 mile radius of the hotel, the hotel offers use of a complimentary Lexus.....so convenient!

We arrived at the hotel to find that there had been a mix up about our reservation; however, the hotel immediately apologized and upgraded us to a beautiful lake-view suite. The service at this hotel is second-to-none. From the moment you arrive in the courtyard and are greeted by the doormen to the friendly front-desk staff, to the maids who service the room, you are made to feel like a special guest. We made use of the courtesy hotel restaurant shuttle, and were assisted in making reservations for attractions and dinner reservations by the concierge. The hotel is only a couple of blocks (and within very easy walking distance) from the Water Tower Center and the other stores on Madison Avenue. Great location! The rooms are decorated in a classic modern style. The bathroom was huge, with a large shower and separate tub. The amenities were very luxurious and there was a lovely balcony overlooking the lake. If you are looking for a first-class hotel with fantastic service and great food...look no further.",

My husband and I enjoyed our 5 year anniversary with our 11 month old twins, another couple and their 18 month old, as well as our babysitter and her boyfriend. The families split the Elysian Suite and I got my babysitter a standard king room. We were all so impressed with the hotel's elegance and charm, and especially by the kindness of the staff. They were always smiling and came to introduce themselves to our kids. The rooms were so comfortable and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms were expansive and modern, and my husband couldn't get over the TV in the mirror. One of the highlights of the trip was the spa. It is one of the nicest hotel spa experiences I can remember, and quite possibly the best massage I've ever had. A few above and beyond things to note. I had asked if we could get high chairs in our suite to feed the kids. Not only were there three high chairs, but it was almost as if they went out and bought brand new ones that day. They obviously had never been used, and they went out of their way to suit our needs. They also brought all of the kids stuffed animals and juice. My babysitter's boyfriend had textbooks in his room and housekeeping accidentally dropped one of his books and tore a page. They called him to apologize profusely, and he wasn't worried about it. He did proceed to ask about a place nearby where he could find a cubs hat. Later that afternoon, they delivered one to his room as an apology for the minor incident. I am ready to go back!!",

No tipping and very courteous - conceirge service was exceptional and arranged our dinner reservations, looked after mailing our parcels, arranged great baseball tickets for us; took us to the L-train and showed us how to use it (we're not from Chicago). Hotel rooms were very spacious - we had 2 bedroom suite with balconies and 2.5 baths, & 2 living/sitting rooms. Great for 2 couples to share and still have together space/time, and private time/space. 2 issues: Maid came to our door every morning at 9am, and every morning we turned her away -- rather irritating on a holiday. And 1 balcony was dirty with old food during our entire stay - even after mentioning to maid. Expensive so these 2 irritants count against value. Otherwise, near perfection.",

We stayed in a suite and the room was spacious and well equipped I particularly loved the giant tub which i spent many a happy hour in there.

And, as far as the review goes-- you have to see it to believe it. All that you read is true-- TVs in the bathroom mirror, plunge tub, terraces, fireplaces.

Although we couldn't enjoy the many facilities and services we had planned to, the location of the hotel made walking a simple exercise, even for somebody well under the weather. About the only amenity I could have wished for, however, was an in-room coffee maker, just to get me on my feet. There was simple coffee in the lobby and all kinds of stuff in the fridge, but if I had felt better, we would have picked up a cup and carb at one of the nearby patisseries to carry back to the suite. Lack of eye-openers notwithstanding, I would recommend this hotel to anyone, whether visiting the city for leisure or business travel.",

But we stayed anyway and were glad. Our balcony looked out over a huge ancient tree with vines and bromiliads all over and sitting there in the evening was magical. the restaurant was huge and had a flavor of times past. The food was OK. There are two modern pools, one cool and the other hot, which are supposed to stay open until 6 or 7 PM. But they drained the hot pool a hour earlier than advertised; this however, shows that they put clean water in daily. There is another set of pools which is not part of the property. They are public, more primative, and more interesting because you can get into many great conversations with the locals, iln English. You reach them easily by walking around the fence at the front entry to the hotel. This place is not for people who like everything neat and clean and perfect, but it is for people who want to see the real Puerto Rico and have a special experience.",

The whole setting is what makes this place special. It was built in 1858 as a coffee plantation house and during the last three decades it's being operated as a parador or bed and breakfast. It's currently operated by the municipality. The staff in general is very kind. The service is nice; the food is what you would find at any puertorrican middle class home. Home style food. Generous portions. Don't expect food cooked by a chef; it's cooked by local women, that cook the same way they cook to their families. Nothing fancy at all but with very nice flavor. The rooms are not in top condition aesthetically speaking but are very clean. They have cable TV. I went with a group that took the whole place for us, and had a blast there. Looking forward to go back.",

        "content": "Hacienda Gripinas is a WONDERFUL place to stay if you want peace and quiet. It is an old hacienda, NOT a hotel, up in the central mountains of Puerto Rico. The views are spectacular! At night, it gets cold--cool breeze from the mountains, ahhhh! We had a huge balcony and would come out at night to relax and drink beer! We were serenated by an orchestra of bugs. It was like being in the middle of a jungle. It was GREAT!!!!! This place is for couples and mature people. Don't bring any kids or immature adults here. Both breakfast and dinner are included and they are both very good. I would recommend the omeletts for breakfast and the chicken asopao for dinner. Our two hosts, Miguel and Juan Carlos, were excellent! They made sure we were enjoying our meal and would accommodate all requests made. Therefore, although tipping is included, we tipped them. Orlando at the front desk could not have been more accommodating. He gave me precise directions to get to the Hacienda, he changed us to a great room because our initial room was leaking water from the toilet, and he even helped us with our bags. I noticed that the people of Jayuya are very proud people. When we went into town and asked people on the street for directions or for the nearby sights, they would stop and very enthusiastically tell you what you needed to know and then they would ask you if you visited this or that other place in Jayuya, and they would tell you what the site meant to them and give you directions on how to get there. Very nice, friendly and decent people. More so here than at other places we have visited. So, my advice to you is treat people with respect and you'll have a far better time. Like others have recommended, I also advise to get here from Ponce (Route 10) even if you come from San Juan. Last year, we took the north route (Route 149), and although you'll see some great mountain panoramic views and small waterfalls, it will take you more than 30 minutes through very narrow and winding roads--it's mountain driving!--and you could get sick.",

I reserved it after being told by the Frommers guidebook that it was close to the Rio Camuy Caves (a worthwhile stop). It wasn't. After an almost 2 hour grueling journey through amazingly twisty roads, we arrived. The lodge building itself is atmospheric, but the rooms are spartan (and you'll likely be sharing it with a mosquito or two). The kitchen tries -- but generally fails -- to deliver high quality food. There are apparently some walks available from the hotel, but they were inaccessible the night of my stay due to a gate being padlocked. One of the two pools was also closed for repair (the other pool was really too icy to be attractive). At least the drive south to Ponce from the inn only took about an hour. The bottomline is that this property isn't nice enough to make it worth the journey. If you want to see what a historic coffee plantation is like, sign up the the Conservation Trust's tour of Hacienda Buena Vista, just a couple miles from Ponce.",

There was a boardwalk extending a short distance out through the mangroves to the water. There was no beach but there is no beach at La Parguera.

        "content": "My wife and I spent 10 days there in March. We were looking for a quiet getaway and we got it. If you want a fast paced casino and beach experience, stay in San Juan and pay a fortune. If you want tranquility, golf, beautiful pools and ocean and a staff that is truly glad you are there, go to the Hilton Ponce Golf & Casino Resort. I suspect most complaints are because the guests were expecting plush urban American facilities. We got a great price for unlimited golf and breakfast. The rooms were great - tile floors, very comfortable beds and quiet, except for the ocean and birds. We loved it. In fact, we wish we were still there. We played about 36 holes of golf every day and had the wonderful golf course almost to ourselves. We went in to Ponce often for dinner and exploring. It was a lot of fun. The golf staff was fantastic. For that matter, all the resort staff were superb. Sancho's Sushi Bar was the only disappointment - food was not good and prices were too high. Coming from San Francisco and Washington DC we have great sushi restaurants. Sancho's could use a rehab. The La Cava restaurant was excellent - food was delicious and properly prices. The waiting staff were fantastic. The La Terraza restaurant was our morning oasis - an outdoor breakfast by a lagoon filled with fish and turtles, plus a great view of the ocean and the pool. What a great way to wake up every morning. The beach is not an idyllic beach, but it is a typical Caribbean beach. I recommend snorkeling on the reefs with Caribbean Images Tours (http://www.caribbeanimagespr.com/caribbeanimagespr.com/Welcome.html) . David Mansfield and his first mate Jorge are great guides. You'll have a fun and safe ecotour of the nearby reef. The 27 hole golf course is fairly new and a stern test when the winds come up in the afternoon. There's plenty of water so bring lots f balls for your first few rounds. Once you get your club selection and routing figured out you will be OK. A few fairways are a little rough due to either too much or too little water, but don't hold that against them. The bunkers were pretty much unplayable, but who cares. Take a drop and have fun. There are lots of birds and iguanas to entertain you along the way. The exercise facility is too small for the size of the facility and could use an expansion and equipment upgrade.",

Our ocean view more than made up for it. Put me on a balcony with an ocean view and I'm loving it! We did not go to the beach on the main property, but we went to the golf course beach because we read on here that it was nicer. But we had a car so we mainly found our own beaches on the south/west side of P.R. The pools were nice but much quieter at the golf course if you don't have kids. We thoroughly enjoyed the golf course and enjoyed 2 days of golf. The staff at the restaurant for breakfast (Executive Lounge is closed on weekends) was amazing! They made us feel welcome, like family, very attentive. Great job! Housekeeping staff was wonderful too!

They have done a lot of work to improve the beach area and make it an attractive alternative to sitting by the pool. The breakfast buffet is wonderful - great coffee, fresh pastries, eggs any way you want them - everything fresh and fabulous. Sometimes the mixed drinks at the pool side bar are weak and more of a fruit juice drink - a minor problem - and once in a while it is hard to find anyone from the bar checking the pool area to see if you want a snack or drink. The staff - it is the people at a hotel who can make your vacation a hit or a miss and, in this case, it is always a hit! From in-house reservations tocheck-in staff to the breakfast chefs, to the restaurant and bar staff, to room service, cleaning staff, etc - always welcoming and helpful. They put in a lot of effort to make your stay enjoyable and I think this is what puts the Ponce Hilton a step above other hotels. As for the few reviews mentioning that rooms are dated and in need of a face lift - it is my understanding that the majority of the rooms in this hotel have been recently renovated.

From the time we arrived (greated with Champagne) to the time we left, we were treated like royalty. Our only concern was the check-out time as our Tour Company was going to pick us up around 9pm, we did not want to have to wait in the lobby for a whole day with nothing to do. Without asking, and I insist, without any request from our part, the check-out staff offered (at no additional cost) to extend the check-out time by 1 hour, to ensure that we could use the resort (and all the restaurants) until we actually leave the property at 9pm, and most importantly, they provided us with a Hospitality Room to shower, change and get ready for our flight back.... Now, that is what I call going above and behond the expectations.... In a few words, this was the ultimate rest and worry-free experience. When I was asked to complete a satisfaction survey, I could not find anything that needs improvement until I remembered the road leading to the resort. There is a very bumpy section shared with 2 other resorts that could use improvement. But..... with the resort, the staff, the restaurants, the pools, the beach, oh! did I mention the staff, the restaurants, the pools, the beach... you know what I mean... with all of that, you are sure to quickly forget about the road... Thank you Secret Maroma, hope to see you soon.... Mr. and Mrs Champagne",

We were guided to our concierge to check in. We were in just awe at the main lobby. The lobby looked into an amazing lobby bar and sitting area with a baby grand piano, and beautiful boutique shops. As we walked outside the lobby bar, the restaurant stretch was to die for!! So many choices and such delightful decor to feel as if you were dining in a romantic upscale dining experience! The ocean from our room was so turquoise. I have never stayed at a place with such an amazing beach. The water was so blue/turquoise. This has got to be one of the Top 10 beaches in the world. The beach is so wide with soft, white sand. We walked the beach and swam in it every day. You can not feel any rocks or seaweed, just pure white sand. We are not even pool people, but we chose for 2 days to lay out by the pool because it was unlike any other pool you have seen. The service from the moment we got there was a \"WOW\" factor in my book. The hotel concierge \"Welcomed us Home\" right when we got there, the servers at the beach/pool never let you thirsty or hungry. The servers at dinner knew exactly how to give you a fine dining experience with the perfect timing between courses. Nothing bad happend, only great things beyond anything I would have expected. We are definetely coming back next year.",

We were offered drinks consistently by our pool waiter :impeccable no waiting. You must reserve the hibashi table ahead of time otherwise always full, we would of liked to have seen dimmer lights and more atmosphere during the night in the restaurants and lobby to make it more cozy and warm. internet works great (5 stations and 1 printer) ,the gym needs to expand 5 machines in 2010 in not enough we found ourselves going to walk on the beach instead because the gym was always full ...but the machines are new and work very well (used them once), overall we will be back this is our second time at secrets maroma things are changing and getting better and better keep up the good work!!!

Understandably, during a UFC weekend in Montreal the prices were inflated but the price of this Hilton was surprisingly competetive compared to other hotels in the area but on a non-event weekend even in the summer it's cheap at $120/night. The location is excellent walking distance to both St. Laurent and St. Catherine's so for nightlife and eating purposes it's great. The service was amazing. I made the mistake of booking a 1king bd instead of the 2-queen I intended. This is one of the few that actually has 2 queens in the room by the way. After realizing the mishap, we went back to the front desk and they were able to find a room to accommodate us with no extra charge. Room was simple but really clean with great comfy sheets and an amazingly comfortable bed. Us girls had a great sleep. I work for public health in Toronto so I'm very cautious about hotels and its cleanliness. This location was very well kept. Security was amazing as well as you need to swipe your room card in order to access the elevators, the parking garage and pretty much virtually every part of the hotel. The staff really make everything easy for their patrons. I highly recommend it.",

        "content": "Actually, we thought we were booked into the OTHER Central Park Hotel, and for what we paid, we should have been. I noticed a review that indicated payment of 25 pounds per night and we paid more than three times that! How were we to know that there are 2 Central Park Hotels! The elevator (lift) was not in working order and we had 2 full suitcases each, plus hand-luggage because we had just come off of a 15 day cruise. I feel sorry for anyone staying in the room beneath ours because the floor squeaked horribly with every step. The curtains on one window were coming down and did not close completely. The first day we had both hand towels and bath towels; after that we only got bath towels. The bed linens were clean and fresh, but consisted of only a bottom sheet and duvet with cover. The first night was quite warm, so we took the cover off the duvet and used the cover as a top sheet. The bathroom was tiny but clean - and sadly in need of an upgrade - but there was no place to put anything! No hair dryer, and I didn't realize that we could have borrowed one from the front office until I happened to see someone return one on the final day of our stay. There were no water glasses in the bathroom or room, but the night registration desk clerk got us 2 when requested. The next morning, when I asked for 1 more, the dining room attendant rudely addressed my request noting there are not enough for everyone to have a glass. Excuse me! If this location is going to advertise as a hotel, then water glasses in the room is a very minor amenity they should provide - along with hand towels. Desk clerks were very friendly and helpful and even loaned us a converter so we could charge our camera batteries. As with other reviewers, I agree that it is conveniently within minutes walking distance to bus or tube transportation. Free internet was nice. As for noise level at night, weekends were very noisy during the late hours; the week-day nights were quiet. Be aware that this location is more of a hostel than a hotel, and not worth what we paid for the accommodation.",

After reading some of the reviews I think some people completely over reacted to the severity of the resorts problems. When we initially arrived at the hotel we were greeted with a smile and were pleasantly surprised at how much the hotel resembled the pictures in the travel brochures. We checked in at about 2 pm and were told our room wasn't ready so we headed to the Seaside restaurant for lunch and upon returning to reception our room was ready. At first, our room's shower was not completely finished, but after making the front desk aware of this it was immediately attended to. Other than that our room was gorgeous. I have stayed at many resorts and never have I had a room that was as nice. Two nights when we went to shower there was no hot water, but once again after calling the front desk that problem was looked after. These types of problems are very common with a new resort and hopefully they will have these glitches worked out sooner than later.All of the restuarants were great with lots of selection. You could always get something made on the spot. The only down side to the main buffet was that none of the food was labelled so at times we had no idea what we were getting into.The beach was incredible. We could walk in either direction for miles and walked the beach everyday for at least an hour. The pool was also great and went on forever. Some people complained of the pools temperature, but it was nice and refreshing amidst the hot weather. Go here with a relaxed attitude and you will have a fanstatic time!",

A worker was putting last finishing touches on the hot tub area which was not a big deal to us. We had two balconies, one facing the pool and ocean and the other with complete privavcy, comfortable lounger for two and hot tub. Our room was beautiful.That night we discovered switch for lights in bathroom and shower did not work (they stayed on all night). We called in the morning and they were fixed right away. That was the only minor problem we had with our room. A friend staying in Junior Suite also had no problems and a beautiful room. We had buffet for breakfast every day and found the choices to be excellent. The baked items were decadent. We had dinner at the Italian Restaurant twice (lasagna was served stone cold and veal scallopini was dry one night and excellent the other. Aside from that we still enjoyed our meals there. We had a wonderful evening at the Gourmet Restaurant (greeted with champagne) as well as the Steakhouse and the Sea  See (shrimp  lobster) overlooking the ocean. This is where we also ate our lunch every day, which was a buffet with lots of choices and a couple of new things every day. The cakes and baking were outstanding. New Year's buffet was superb. Greeted with champagne at the door and there was everything under the sun on the buffet - it was a real extravaganza. We found all staff to be attentive, friendly and quick to serve. Before going, having read some of the reviews and room problems, I was worried but I can now say that this was one of the best holidays I have ever had (cruises included). The people were excellent and any issues we did have were remedied in short order, including lack of face clothes. Initially, we did not get any in our room but when we asked they were there every day following. Staff are very eager to please. There was champagne and fruit plate in our room on arrival and again champagne to enjoy on New Year's Eve. New Year's eve, there was a band, excellent show, and fireworks. In all, we had an excellent time at the Majestic Elegance. We saw every day, workers ironing out the room and facilities problems but again, we had two rooms and both had no problems that weren't fixed within minutes of letting the front desk know. Would definitely go back.",

We warned by our travel agent that this was a new hotel and everything might not be open for our trip but I never imagined it could be so bad. Upon 1st arrival they did not have our reservation in their system and it took an hour to straighten that out and the manager was very rude. The when we finally get to our room it just had a foul odor, which I thought maybe I could just get used to. The room is beautiful but had exposed wires, broken tiles, back door didn't lock, A/C worked intermittently, and mosquitoes bit us all night as we slept. And then when you take a shower it floods the room. We called to have someone look at the door and AC but no one ever came and were told the slding doors all had the wrong locks. As for the food it was horrible - buffet was cold and the french place was horrendous. The positives were the wait and bar staff, all were very friendly but the bar had only one beer available - Presidente. The beach and pool were nice. Stay away from this place until it matures - it has potential but right now it is a mess.",

I have generally found design driven hotels to be lacking in service but this was not the case here as the service was as good as the design. The hotel is a stones throw away from 118 floor high International Commerce Center in west Kowloon that houses the Ritz Carlton Hotel. As i stayed there only for one night i couldnt really use all available facilities but the breakfast was extensive and the cafe had a great view. Within the room the most striking feature is the mini bar that had the most extensive selection ever, right down to an umbrella and a multi pin adapter! All in all it was a very nice stay and like all hotels in Hong Kong, quite expensive.",

        "content": "I stayed there with my Mom for two nights last summer, and we had a wonderful experience. We actually live in Shenzhen - the great city immediately to the north of Hong Kong - but I was leaving for Taipei, so I HAD to stay in Hong Kong before I could go back to mainland after Taiwan, and I didn't book the hotel until 20 days beforehand - well, sorry that's another story. My point is therefore W Hotel was kinda pricy to me (compared to many other non-branded upper upscale hotels in HKG), but it was worth a visit to the leading boutique hotel and the adjacent Elements Mall. $$$$$ was well-spent. The location is great. The hotel is right above the Kowloon Train Station, and it's only 20-30 minutes train (subway) ride from the airport if my memory is correct. Based on my experience, the train still ran at 9:40PM and 5AM. Also, I flew Cathay Pacific to Taipei and got checked in right at the train station, so I didn't have to carry my checked bags to go on the train- I liked it so much. It's connected to the Elements Mall, and I personally liked it better than the Harbor City because it was newer and far less crowded. I had no trouble finding things I wanted that I would be able to get at the Harbor City. Front desk staff spoke fluent English and okay Mandarin. Hotel staff were nice and always greeted us with smiles, especially service people at breakfast buffet. W Hong Kong truly met its service level and my expectations. On the first night, we chcked in late and were lucky to get upgraded to a harbor view double room for two nights. Beds were really comfortable, and I absolutely loved the compartmentalized bathroom. I had never used Bliss before, but in-room Bliss body/skin-care products totally turned me into a loyal Bliss customer now. Use of technology and decor were very advanced and artsy, but not too overwhelming. Their housekeeping did a good job, too. It has happened to me many times before that your room didn't get fully cleaned if your stay is longer, but everything looked nice and clean again like a new guestroom after housekeepers came in on our second day. I also used their infinity pool. You'll have to try it, if it's your first stay at the W Hong Kong. It was just so good to see all the skyscrapers nearby in your bathing suits on that fancy rooftop. Although I could smell the chemicals, my hair was fine after swimming in the pool. I heared the spa is really good too. Breakfast was good but not impressive, basic Western style. Don't remember if it was complimentary. If I do have to pay next time, I probably won't have it. (228HKD or something). Personally, I'd just prefer to go to some yum dim sum at other cheap places. Come on, you're in Hong Kong. BTW, passed by W Barcelona last week, and it looked so gorgeous - even better than this one. Regret not having statyed there. I'm kinda a W fan now. - 距离香港国际机场搭机场快线很方便。早上5点多和晚上10点左右都还有车。还可直接在九龙火车站就办理手续。 很喜欢圆方，比海港城人少，逛得舒服。东西很全也很高端，也可丰简由君。 海景房很宽敞，浴室很棒。Bliss的产品很舒服。游泳池值得一去。早餐一般，如果要自掏腰包，不划算。 很喜欢这间W, 以后有机会还会去。",

The rooms are beautiful and spacious, especially in comparison with other hotels in HK. Having had a chance to peek in at a suite I could tell that it really does get even better, not just a little couch and tv but a proper suite. Aside from all the great things about the hotel there's even a airport check-in counter in the same building.. The only downside might be that it's in Kowloon and not on the main drag but there's a free shuttle to get to the main part of Kowloon and a train that takes you to central HK. Definitely recommend staying here and will definitely be back!",

This is the anti-stuffy hotel. I remember not one but two guys delivering my luggage to my room after check-in. One guy was Billy, wearing big thick rimmed glasses. Couldn't tell whether he loved his job, or was really well trained to demonstrate fun... regardless I really felt the W's cool atmosphere. The Kitchen (name of the buffet restaurant) is really cool too. I am a simple cereal eater for breakfast, but I found my favorite cereals already in a little mason jar. I grabbed an other bottle of milk and a mango juice with the same mason-jar lids. So cool. Only bummer was I was helping run a conference in one of the meeting rooms, and the doors to the meeting rooms are like city gates. Massive and hard to push open! You cannot quietly slip out of the room without heaving the doors open. Ok, I had to say something negative! But that's about it. I still prefer the InterContinental, but this one's a must stay if you need to see how cool and fun a hotel can be.",

So, I have to admit that this location is definitly MUCH better. Much more within a 3 block radius, including a supermarket, Ralphs. The hotel is brand new. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are huge. The pool on the 4th floor is gorgeous, and I LOVED the Illy caffe in the lobby...my favorite coffee place...sure beats starbucks anyday. That being said theres a starbucks within steps from the hotel..as is so many restaurants, and the staples center! Now as far as service...I guess it was fine. Nothing in particular happened for them to demonstrate extraordinary service, but they were always friendly from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. Now I just had 2 complaints. ONE, no free wifi/internet in the room. Its $12.95 a day!!! I thought this is ridiculous since this isnt a run of the mill hotel. BUT!!!! i found out the way around it! ish! There IS free wifi in the lobby. So you can connect to the wifi in the lobby then go to your room and you have a free hour! et voila! The other thing is that they dont provide microwaves. Now if you are only staying a few days, who cares, but since I was there for almost 2 weeks, to save money I bought alot of groceries and it would of been nice to have (as i had in the westin). So considering that was my only 2 complaints, which neither are too significant, I definitely give this hotel 5 stars!!! And did I mention the pool area is GORGEOUS!",

        "content": "My husband and I stayed for 2 nights this past week. First the positive: Front desk and concierge service is top notch. Rooms are spacious and clean. The location Is great if you are attending an event. Areas that need serious improvement: The service in both the lobby lounge and the mixing longe is absolutely terrible. On a Monday evening we went to the mixing lounge and sat at a table (the bar was full but the seating area only had 8 people seated) and waited for approximately 10 minutes to order. There were 2 waitresses working but seemed to be more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. I finally went to the bar and ordered. In the hour I was seated at a table not 1 of the staff asked if I would like anything else or even approached me. this is unacceptable particularly when you are paying top $$ for cocktails. The lobby bar is not much better. I was also really disappointed in the housekeeping service. I left my room at approx. 1 PM and saw that housekeeping was servicing the adjacent room. I returned to my room at 5PM and the room had not been cleaned. I spoke with the front desk and they acted like it was no big deal and they would have someone service it. I'm sorry but at $300+ a night it was a big deal to me. The gym is great but he again the staff really need to work on their customer service skills. Too long of a story to bother with... For $300+ a night there should be free internet service for all guests in their room. Also, be aware that overnight parking charges are ridiculous at $40 per night.",

Located right next to LA Live, and while there isn't too much to do here unless there are events going on (ex: sports, concerts etc) it was a pleasant and enjoyable stay. I came in late morning and they were still able to accommodate an early check-in and room upgrade (junior suite) with a view overlooking their pool. The room itself was very nice and I appreciated the early check in as well as the upgrade. The Lounge is great to grab a few snacks on the go, and the pool is a great place to relax at. I was visiting friends in the area and was not familiar with the area so Concierge was very helpful in helping me get to where I needed to go. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, a great experience",

So here it is oct of 2011 as we are in the process of moving to Seattle and again we stayed at the bell town inn, and again what a wonderful experience, we are going back and forth for interviews and this place always makes us feel so welcome. the best part is we take light rail from the airport to westlake and then a very short six blocks and you have arrived at the inn. I recomend this wonderful inn",

We thoroughly enjoyed our days and nights during the stay, were able to walk to Pike Place Market, great restaurants, and local shopping. The staff was knowledgeable about restaurants and totally accommodating to our requests; kudos to Courtney, Cesar, Rachel and others whose names I can't remember. The neighborhood around the hotel was filled with interesting characters, but no one ever harassed us or made us feel uncomfortable. Room was very comfortable, even though not air-conditioned. Could hear some \"discussion\" through the courtyard on our last night there, but it subsided pretty quickly. Definitely a place we would look to stay again; Seattle people are the best hosts!",

The hotel staff was so accommodating and helped us with anything we needed. They recommended great places to eat and see. They have free bikes you can rent to tour the city that includes a bike lock and a helmet. It is a hotel for a more younger crowd. I wouldn't necessarily want to take my family there. There was just a younger crowd. I highly recommend this place to anyone that was an affordable and comfortable hotel in Seattle.",

The hotel is in a great spot within easy walking distance of the restaurants and bars of Fells Point. Room felt very \"homey\" and comfortable. Friendly staff. 2 drawbacks, no bell staff to help with baggage and bad pillows. Otherwise it was great. Definitely get tickets for the Aquarium at the hotel and save yourself a lot of time and money.",

The room was spacious, the beds were very comfortable, but the room could have had more light. We kept our shades closed because our room was on the ground level (as are all the rooms) and we did not want walker/runners along the pier peering into our room. But, our view from the room of the harbor was lovely. Service: There could be more front desk staff. During our stay, it seemed like the young lady working the front desk was extremely busy and she was the only person at the front desk working until the next morning. Inspite of this, she provided great service. The bottle of wine upon check-in is a nice touch. Food: the continental breakfast was fantastic and was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. The continental breakfast offered nice variety and the fool was delicious. The woman who tended to the breakfast was friendly and efficient; she provided great service. Value: Truly, the only issue I had with the hotel was the price. It's an expensive hotel for what one receives. My wife and I have been fortunate to travel and stay in some great hotels worldwide and it seems in our travels; we have experienced more for what we paid for at other hotels than what we paid for at the Henderson's Wharf Inn. The Henderson's Wharf Inn is a nice hotel and I will recommend it, but it could add something more.",

We love Baltimore and all there is to do there, but more importantly than the town is the place -- and this is it! There is just this feeling of \"ahhh\" as you walk in, feeling like you've just entered the home of a dear friend. From the welcoming lobby (and front desk staff) to the wine in your room to the beautiful furnishings, you'll know within ten minutes of your arrival that you picked the right place! The rooms are very large and furnished like a bedroom out of a model home. You will not feel in the least like you are staying in a hotel! The mattresses and sheets are top of the line -- you'll get a wonderful night's sleep! The breakfast is just incredible with every sort of fresh fruit, crunchy granola, a large assortment of fresh breads and pastries, cheese and crackers, many fresh fruits -- you name it, it's there! I took pictures but somehow they got deleted from my camera card and I'm very disappointed because I've described this place to my friends, but it's not until they saw the pictures on my camera that they realized how truly unique and wonderful this place is. The front desk staff will attend to your every need and are so gracious and pleasant to deal with. The Inn at Henderson's Wharf combines the best of a Bed and Breakfast (charm, good food, warm ambiance) with the privacy and luxury of an upscale hotel. The water taxi comes within a few minutes of the front door -- it gets you wherever you want to go in Baltimore within minutes at a very low cost. We would never consider staying anywhere else when we're in Baltimore and in fact consider the Inn a destination in itself!",

The inn’s entrance, lobby, and rooms are nicely decorated and very comfortable. The inn provides luxurious robes, a complimentary bottle of wine, and a well-stocked snack and beverage bar. The Inn also provides complimentary breakfast, which is enough to get you going in the mornings. You can enjoy your breakfast, weather permitting, in their courtyard garden. It’s worth noting that the inn’s guest rooms are on the first floor with either marina or garden views. The floors above are residences, which add to the appeal. You never quite feel like a tourist, and instead feel quite at home. The cobblestone streets, shops, pubs (lots of them), cafés and restaurants of Fell’s Point might keep you busy and away from the Inner Harbor. However, if you do remember to visit the harbor, you're within walking distance. The walk will take you along the water’s edge, or you can just as easily take the water-taxis that will take you back and forth all day long for one fare. Please try the taxis at nights; the city lights are wonderful at night! I’ll be returning again, and will only consider staying at Henderson’s Wharf Inn!",

        "content": "We have stayed here several times, at least once on the concierge level. This time we just had a standard room, typical Marriott, comfy beds, nicely furnished, granite countertops, single serving coffee/tea maker, mini frig, about average size for a hotel in the heart of the city. The location cannot be beat - the T is right outside, as is the harbor, the aquarium, the (very good) Legal Seafood restaurant and, of course, Quincy Market and the North End. Even the tour buses and harbor tour boats are right there. Also positive - great view of harbor from our room, a new lobby with a very welcoming bar/restaurant, with tv screens everywhere including some for your private viewing in the booths. A few negatives - no newspaper delivered to the door, USA Today and WSJ are available in lobby but no local newspapers. Would be nice to have the Boston Globe to check out local events and get a feel for the city. For the first time, our stay here was very noisy. We are silver Rewards members with standing request for quiet room, which has always been honored in the past. Our room was on the fifth floor, but it fronted on the atrium, right over the bar/lounge/restaurant. Not sure if they had a convention meeting there or just a large crowd, but it was noisy well into the night. I would definitely ask for a room away from the atrium if we return, and stay elsewhere if they couldn't guarentee it. Also, they charge for internet use, even in the lobby and the business center. They do have computers in the business center for free use, but center is not very private (no door, and it's open to the lobby). I also found that I could not navigate on their computers as I would on my laptop, there seemed to be some limitations -- and I was not trying to access any racy sites!! Just gmail, trip advisor, and some event listings. The towels were also extremely thin, not at all up to the standard that the price of the room would suggest. The room lacked a magnifying mirror, which is surprising with all the business people (incl women) who stay there. Altho the new lobby was nice, we did miss the seating near the Starbucks downstairs (the ground floor has just Starbucks, registration & lobby are up a flight). Before the renovations there was seating for Starbucks so you could have breakfast there or relax with coffee and pastry in afternoon. Now it is \"to go\" only, so you'd have to bring your coffee and treats back to the room or eat/drink on the go. Wondering if they eliminated seating to encourage guests to have breakfast in their newly renovated restaurant??",

There is no safety measure built under, so it's a straight drop to a few floor down. It was a scary experience. Tried to write and talk to someone in the hotel regarding this matter but no one seemed to notice or care. Also, there were a lot of drunken people being very loud outside the corridor in the middle of the night.",

We have one pre-teen and two teenagers. I ended up reserving one room and requesting a roll away. We arrived very late on our arrival day (nearly midnight) and were relieved the roll away was already in our room. The hotel was under renovation, so felt compartmentalized and rather plain, but the cleaning staff added her own sense of sparkle to our stay which dramatically improved our opinion of the hotel. (Smiles, fresh towels, spotless room, etc...) The location was picturesque and easy. You can hop on the T literally right outside the door and there were dining options within steps of the hotel. One evening, our tired kids grabbed dinner across the street at Quincy Market and headed back to the hotel while my husband and I had a leisurely dinner at Legal Seafoods, also across the street. We did not spend a lot of time at the hotel, but found it convenient and comfortable for our stay. Positives: location, comfortable beds, excellent staff. Negatives: a little noisy.",

The hotel is under construction but they had someone there to guide you where to go at all times. We were able to check in very early. Unfortunately the room we were given was right above the outdoor bar area which was very loud on a Saturday night. We called the front desk around midnight to see how late the bar would be hopping and when we got our bill in the morning, they had comped us half the cost! We were very impressed with the management. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. But the location is the best thing about this hotel (besides the Starbucks in the lobby).",

At time of booking (early June) it mentioned construction was to be finished by mid May 2011. Big surprise to find out at checking in that construction was far from over. First morning 7:10 AM we woke up at the sound of heavy construction machinery... Unacceptable! We were moved to another section of the hotel which was far less noisy, but ..... why put guests in rooms so close to the construction in the first place when other rooms are available??? Besides the construction sounds, the hotel is built in such a manner that the noise from public area below, lobby and/or events areas cannot be blocked from most rooms. That means when in your room you will certainly hear kids running around and doors being shut(throughout the night!). We were 'forced' to enjoy the music of a wedding taking place in the events area and sounds of breakfast taking place in that same area since the restaurant was temporarily under construction. Finally, service is courteous but certainly not friendly or warm. Rooms are spacious, neat and housekeeping is good. Marriott: Yes! Boston Marriott Longwharf: No!!",

        "content": "We have stayed in or near Boston a few times before, but this was our first time at the Long Wharf. We were able to get a decent rate as a Marriott Rewards members - $195/night (although still a little hard to swallow with tax and daily parking fees but it was our five year anniversary). The location was by far one of the better places we have ever stayed in Boston. It was not even a five minute walk to Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market, and the North End was less than 10 minutes away. It was right along the water, which we probably would have taken advantage of more had the weather been nicer, but it was still a beautiful area with plenty to do. We also took advantage of one of the trolley tours which in some ways was like door to door service because the main stop is on the side of the hotel. I would definately return to the Marriott Long Wharf, and think it would be a fabulous place for the kids. Besides the aquarium, and other area attractions, there is a small park next to the hotel that has a small playscape and there is even a carousel just outside the back entrance. I cannot really comment on the service or amenities because we did not use any of the facilities or have a need to call the front desk or house keeping. The only somewhat of a downside is that the hotel does not have an area for free coffee and fruit (not a necessity, just a nice perk) although there was a Starbucks on the lower floor and there is the option to make it in your room. We were not expecting a free breakfast with our stay, so to keep the cost minimal (we splurged on lunch and dinner) we just grabbed bagels at Quincy Market in the morning. Overall, it was a very nice stay, and based on the location alone, I would definately recommend it to anyone with or without children. Our stay was pleasant, our room was clean, the beds were comfortable, there was a big screen TV in the room. In and out, our needs were met. Wish the price could have been slightly lower, but we knew that going into our stay that we could get a place with a lower price and free breakfast just outside of the mainstay. . . but then you lose the ambiance of staying in the city.",

It was nice and clean, quiet even though it is a huge hotel, and very comfortable, even with 4 adults in one room.

The check in and check out process was quick and painless. The beds were decent but the bathrooms showed their age and the floors are very slippery when wet, even with a towel down. Beware of the concierge, they seemed to be pushy when it came to getting a cab or taking the hotel truck, although either will set you back about $30 to Logan.",

In a nutshell - rude bell staff (note I will not tip poor service and bad attitudes just because you expect it), rude front desk staff and staff who had to be kept out of the room - you may have been desperate to clean it but check out is 12 (and no later). This hotel has the smallest hotel room I have ever seen in the USA. Poor beyond words. Great location but that's all it's got going for it (don't be hopeful from the grand entrance and internet pictures!)",

        "content": "I spent one night here on a quick getaway to do my own historical walking tour. The hotel touts its own history and though nice, I was not particularly impressed overall. The Park Plaza seemed almost as though it was trying to be too many things to too many people...more than one wedding booked (large lighted ,glossy photos and names of couples in lobby detracting from the historic decor), lots of high maintenance vacationers, European travelers, even airline flight crews. Amid the shuffle, I felt a bit overlooked as a lone traveler. At one point, I waited in a long line for the Concierge to ask for a walkable map of the historic African-American sites trail, only to be told hurriedly that they didn't have any but \"the trail starts on the other side of the park\". The group in front of me in line however, booked a boat tour, made dinner reservations for a family of 4, and got directions from the Concierge. All I wanted was a map. Maybe it would have been better had I not been traveling in the middle of the summer? In any case, the rooms have a nice historic flair (skeleton key doors) and are small but perfectly acceptable. The room was clean but my bed sheet was stained, which was pretty unexpected considering the caliber of the hotel. Overall, I could not have asked for a better location and for the seasoned traveler who needs little direction or attention, it was a reasonable choice.",

        "content": "I booked a junior suite at the Park Plaza for our family vacation. Upon check in, there were no junior suites, so we were upgraded to some fabulous 2-room suite on the 15th floor of the Towers. It was lovely and the 15th floor suites include complimentary evening appetizers and morning breakfast. The 2-room suite accomodated us nicely and we were very gracious for the upgrade. However, the airconditioning would not go below 77-degrees (It was set to be 64-degrees when we arrived)!. Granted, on day one, Boston got hit by the near 100-degree heat wave. On day 2, i made 3 requests between 9 am and 10:45 pm for the AC to be looked at and i also requested a portable fan for the room. Sleeping night number one was miserable, difficult and hot! Anyhow, after my 3rd request for assistance, and it was now 11:15 PM and I needed to go to bed, so i walked down to the front desk and nicely explained my unhappiness and discomfort. The desk clerk appologized profusely and gave me her portable box fan from behind the counter. I was happy to have a fan at last, but displeased that my 3 earlier requests were disregarded. On day number 3 the room temp with AC would still only go down to 77, although the weather out was pleasant and mildat 78-degrees. We opened our windows and slept with them open because it was cooler out than in. All other aspects of the hotel were grand. The location right by a T station and 1 block from the Boston Public Garden can't be beat. The hotel is not cheap to stay at, and we were still paying a good chunk of change to stay there regardless of recieving an upgrade, so it is not accecptable to disregard a guests request for room comfort. Still, despite the AC situation, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.",

They have retained the historic quality while updating the hotel so the common areas (lobby, restaurants, and meeting space) are really nice. For a business traveler with all expenses covered, it is a great hotel. For anyone else, it is rather expensive even beyond the room rate and Boston taxes that apply to all the hotels in this area. The Park Plaza basically has no parking so you must use valet parking that was $44 a night (plus tips), which seemed very high even by Boston standards. Web access was over $10 a day, and it was unreliable. The bars and restaurants were expensive compared to other places in the neighborhood so leave the hotel to eat. I would generally not recommend it for families as the historic hotel rooms and especially the bathrooms are too small for more than one or two people. There is also no pool.",

Just a short walk to Trinity Church (a must see), Copley Place, Prudential Center. The hotel is quite lovely - spacious lobby, lounge, and numerous restaurants. We splurged for a concierge level room (they call it the tower level) at a conference rate of $365 per night, including tax, so quite expensive I think. Our room was spotlessly clean, the king bed was very comfortable, and the large flat screen TV worked ok. The bathroom was miniscule. In fact we could not open the door all the way, because the toilet blocked the door! And the bathtub has this very strange gel-like padding on the bottom. It made for a rather dangerous shower, since you had to worry about keeping your balance. Just don't close your eyes, or you might fall over! The size of the room and bathroom are typical of older, historic hotels. But this bathroom was REALLY teeny. The concierge level had a nice lounge that served an ok breakfast and a nice afternoon snack with a cash bar. Overall the Park Plaza is an ok place to stay. Just don't expect a large room like you might get at the newer hotels. It's an historic building. Great staff, very accomodating.",

We went July 16th weekend when highs were in the mid 90's! I made it a point to request a room with a king and air conditioning that cranked when we checked in and the front desk came through!! This is a historic hotel with lots of character! There are a ton of dining opportunities in the building itself or right across the street, Legal Seafood, McCormick and Schmicks, PF Changs, among others. Our room was huge and had two separate bathrooms as well (free upgrade to Deluxe)...the bathrooms were on the small side but nice to have my own bathroom!! The shower pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water! The bed was super comfortable with both down pillows and regular foam pillows. TV wasn't plasma or LCD but was 32 inch and had plenty of channel opportunity. coffee maker was a krups machine with 4 servings to brew! The fitness Center wasn't your typical 10x10 room....they had several precor machines, free weights, a yoga room and strength training machines! If I go back to Boston I will definitely stay at the Boston Park Plaza! We booked through Priceline and got a fantastic deal!!!",

        "content": "I stayed twice at the Boston plazas and had slightly different experiences. It's located in Back Bay, which is a great area that is accessible to many things and nice to walk around during the day. At night, it's quite deserted and there isn't even many take away or fast food options if you are looking to eat (I had to eat food from a CVS store..). The check in the first time was breezy, however he wouldn't let me use my credit card that still had the generic card as I hadn't received the new one. The signature matched my identifitication.. but anyway, go to the atm he tells me. The atm was out of service, so i had to walk to a bank. Minor inconvenience, but inconvenience in any event. The lobby is very nice and there are many staff members on hand to assist you in you need help. The room was very-very large (as big as a suite almost) and had 2 double beds. There was a desk area, lcd and windows that opened to a sheltered roof that clearly many people sat out and smoked on. The bathroom was large in size with a full bath and seat in there, so perhaps it was a disabled access room (explains the size?). My only complaint about the room was the noise associated with the old heat/cool system, so loud. The room was next to the ice machine too, so some noise. The breakfast was sufficient (fruit plate, berries, muffins and coffee with juice) and there were no complaints with service otherwise. There was a candy/drink machine in the iceroom which was convenient also. But they didn't accept many coins or notes (evens ones listed, just shoots them back.. randomly), so I think they need updating or calibrating. The second stay I was placed in a much smaller and dated room. The bathroom was a lot smaller, but still had a bathtub. The tv was older however, but there was an nice street view available. I received an express checkout slip under the door the night of leaving, which was missed during the first stay. The girl checking me in accepted my credit card with no questions. All in all a pleasent stay, some inconsistencies within the hotel - but with a hotel of this size.. you half expect it. Gym is small but open 24 hours. Some of the equipment needs updating.",

The hotel has been kept up with new carpets, drapes, fresh paint, and renovated bathrooms. The bed linens were beautiful and comfortable. Everything was spotlessleslly clean. In other reviews I noticed people complaining about noise/thin walls, but my husband and I did not notice anything like that. Our 3-day stay was quiet and thoroughly pleasant. We would definitely come back. Tip: If you want to park and leave your car for the duration of your stay, you can save by using the self-parking garage across the street, but be aware it does not have in & out privileges.",

The heating and windows need to be replaced with more efficient ones since there was a horrible draft and the thermostat needed to be turned up to accomodate the draft.

Where the hotel is located is really close to good eats, so no worries there! Plus, they do offer a shuttle bus tour of Boston that I highly recommend!

        "content": "I booked this hotel for Thanksgiving weekend via Priceline. Then after reading reviews here, I was initially disappointed, especially given comments about the small bathrooms and poor service (I went with my wife and children, ages 4 years and 6 months). Our experience was fantastic. To address my initial concerns, I'd say that the bathrooms were small but that the service was very good (special thanks to Ari, who worked the front desk). Further, the other folks at the front desk seemed courteous and helpful when approached by hotel guests. A few comments about the Deluxe room we stayed in...The room was well-maintained (not 4-star quality, but I wasn't expecting this). Bathrooms, as others have noted, are tiny, and the tile floors could use a little refurbushing. When I asked about why the rest of the hotel was updated but not the bathroom floors, one of the employees indicated that the tiles were untouched to retain hotel's \"charm.\" For me, the small bathroom size was not a big deal, but I can see how it might alter the experience for some. Regarding amenities, we weren't a frequent consumer of the hotel's ancillary offerings. We didn't use the business center (not free), breakfast (expensive), gym (I'm building a tire, if you know what I mean). So, buyer beware. The hotel's lobby is fantastic. Christmas decorations were already up, and there is plenty of seating - several guests were reading newpapers or enjoying take-out dessert. Very spacious and luxurious setting, all in all. Parking is $40/night at the hotel. I opted for the covered parking across the street (where Maggiano's guests park) because it's slightly cheaper at $31/night. Last but not least, the location is perfect. The Arlington station (green line) is less than a block away. Boston Common/Public Garden is a block or two away. Chinatown is a 10-minute walk (with kids). And there are several dining options either inside the hotel (McCormick & Schmicks, Melting Pot, Ben & Jerrys) or within 1 block (Smith & Wollensky, Finale for dessert, PF Changs, Maggiano's, Legal Seafood). I'd stay here again.",

While the lobby is convincing enough that this is a worthy hotel, immediately upon entering my room, I realized that this hotel was completely overrated. I'm usually pretty laid back about this sort of thing, but I'm pretty sure my first apartment in Chicago, after I graduated from college, was nicer than this. Bathroom is decaying and its clear there's been no attempt to even attempt an upgrade (the fixtures are all cheap and old). TV is circa 1990. Room generally feels old and dirty (see attached pictures of bathroom and window shade). Gym smelled and many pieces of equipment were rusty. Other comments on this site regarding the general lackadaisical attitude of the concierge were right on, although the front desk staff was helpful. Overall, I fully understand why the other Starwood properties were sold out and this one wasn't (even at almost half the cost!).",

The bathrooms are very tiny for American standards, along with dirty, cracked caulking, poorly draining tubs - you get the picture. Also, they appear to be very stingy with toiletries. I went two days in a row with one bar of soap for the shower and sink until I swiped another from the housekeeper's cart. After four days here, still am not provided with another body lotion. Time for another swipe...Rooms are noisy. On the 11th floor, the traffice noise is quite noticeable (and there are a lot of sirens in Boston). The fire alarm system malfunctioned - although it DID NOT AWAKEN us to evacuate (which is worrisome), the very loud announcements that it was OK to reenter the building did. Then we were in bed thinking what the heck - what if there had been a real fire??? Obviouisly, my first choice for another stay.",

Rooms were just fine, for what little time we spent there. I would recommend an ocean view though because the sunsets are unbelievable. The only negative was the parking situation if you get back in the evening with a rental car. We would stay there again, and we can't wait to.

We didn't want to pay for the upgrade; we knew we would spend in restaurants, etc. but did talk to the manager about our anniversary. He put us on the 10th floor, mtn view, recently renovated room, smaller than other Westins, but we knew that ahead of time from research. The armoire and all the drawers available were quite suffiicient, and there was actually room under the beds for our luggage, and with four of us, that was a big help. The heavenly beds, wireless internet, and small frig; what more could you ask for at this price? Oh, yeah, how about a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries sent up to our room from the manager? We were greeted with leis at the door upon arrival, and no, the lobby is not as over the top as other hawaiian hotels, but very pretty with the koi pond and waterfalls and birds. Yes it was a busy hotel, it was the holidays (Jan 2-7); there are a lot of families there enjoying themselves; honestly, don't go to a resort if you want to be alone. We ate breakfast by the pool one rainy morning; the spinach benedict was yummy, and large enough to share for two. I used the work out room, but didn't have to wait for a machine like someone else did. We ate at the dinner at the lower Leilani Grill; great location, food not really memorable; lunch at the Hula Grill, goat cheese pizza was tasty and our teens said they made the best virgin pinas. In Lahaina, we had a wonderful dinner at the Lahaina Fish Company (get the scallops), and another night a delicious meal at the Lahaina Store and Grill, a new restaurant (the lamb lollies were to die for!) To end our trip, we rented a condo in Wailea, at the Ekolu Village for three nights. Found an ocean view unit from VRBO.com. We had a great experience overall.",

Within hours of making our initial reservation, the front desk made our reservations at the French Laundry and sent us other recommendations for restaurants in the area. Upon, arriving they provided plenty of information about regional wineries. It's also within within walking distance to the many incredible restaurants and wineries in Yountville. Free breakfast is served daily and surpasses what most hotels serve as a continental breakfast. I have no complaints and would happily stay there again.",

I was warmly greeted. I had a room at the far end looking out over a vineyard. A great bottle of wine awaited me in the spotless room. Internet was fast and free. Loved the beautiful renovated bathrooms and first-class toiletries. Unfortunately, I did not have time to go for a swim or use the hot tub. But, I can't wait to go back and swim some laps in the beautiful, heated pool. Breakfast was very nice, bountiful, and fresh. If I have to offer one less than glowing comment, it would be that my bed, sheets, and pillows at home are more to my liking.",

Our room was spacious, clean and tastefully, yet simply appointed. The bathroom was immaculate and recently renovated with lovely tile and seamless shower. We had a great little patio overlooking the pool. The plus was that it was within walking distance of the fabulous restaurants such as French Laundry and Bouchon. We did not eat their breakfast buffet, opting to walk to local eateries instead. The lodge is more like a motel in the sense that the room doors face outside to the parking lot, but we really enjoyed our stay there. The Location was fabulous and I plan to stay there again!",

It has the best restaurants, great shops, delicious bakery, streets to wonder and spectacular views! It is so easy to get to the vineyards, and there are many wine tasting opportunities in downtown. The hotel provided free wine tasting in the lobby many evenings. The hotel breakfast was delicious. Relaxing in the hot tub or sitting by the fire pit in the evening was the perfect ending to a glorious day in the wine country. I would recommend staying on the 2nd floor as we could hear people above us. Also a room with a view is best!",

Although Napa is only 45 minutes away once we checked into our hotel we felt miles and miles away from our day to day lives. The Napa Valley Lodge was just what we needed. The service was outstanding. The complimentary breakfast was delicious. Our room was lovely with an incredible view that overlooked the pool and beautiful vine covered hills. We spent one day touring local eateries and wineries and the next day recuperating by the pool. The pool side service was great and my husband and I treated ourselves to massages. Loved loved loved this place. We are already talking about the same exact trip next year!! BTW....the location is fantastic. Yountville is our favorite town. The best restaurants in the area all within walking distance. So feel free to eat, drink, and then safely walk back to the hotel!!",

The room was very spacious, clean, modern, with a wood-burning fireplace that we lit each evening. The bathroom was recently remodelled with slate and marble, it was large, with a huge shower and separate make-up area. Breakfast was ok - a bit boring, so we ate at Bouchon Bakery, and the Model Bakery in St. Helena as well. We had surprisingly good weather while there (in the mid-70's), and sat by the pool in the afternoons. The pool area is beside the vineyard, beautifully landscaped, there is a fire-pit close by that is lit in the evenings. The hotel is very close to all of the wonderful restaurants in Yountville (we highly recommend Bottega, Bouchon and Redd!). For the price we paid (hotel web special), the NVL was great value. We probably would not stay there again if the rate was higher than what we paid.",

They advertise a complinentary champagne breakfast buffet with the room. I can't belive they have gotten away with calling it a buffet for this long without every guest complaining. There was NO warm food. It was in a little room off the pool and was a medicore continental breakfast at best. There was danishes, toast, bagels, cereal, and yogurt.

The location was perfect for our first trip to Napa, as there were tons of great vineyards in the immediate area. Twomey, was one of our favorite small tours. Castillo di Amorosa was especially interesting as it was a reconstructed Italian Castle! Amazing! The Wine Spectator Greystone restaurant, part of the Culinary Institute of America is right down the road also. We had a great meal there. Also great for casual dining we liked Pizzera Tra Vigne right at the Inn. Across the street is Taylorâ€™s Refresher, a great old fashion drive-in, recently featured on the Food Networkâ€™s \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\" Worth the wait in line!

The hotel is located in the midst of a lovely olive grove, which is a wonderful setting, but that means the bus stop is not close to the hotel. If you have cumbersome luggage, be prepared for a tedious 10 min. hike. Aside from the jaunt from the bus stop (which they cannot be faulted for since their setting is delightful), we have absolutely no complaints about the hotel. The staff were accomodating and acquired reservations to the various museums for us upon request. We dined once in the evening at the hotel's restaurant and enjoyed the entire meal. They even let us sit by the fire place with our wine after the restaurant had closed down - they just asked that we turn out the lights when we left. The hotel rooms and living areas are furnished like a home - cozy and inviting. To top it off, the price is a steal. We highly recommend Villa Rondini (oh, and you can get great views of the city from the hotel gardens and grounds).",

I then called in at the hotel, where I was offered a cheaper room - but still not as cheap as their adverts. The room itself was dreadful. The radiator didn't work so I could not regulate the temperature. The tiny television only had one channel. There were no towels in the bathroom, which was cramped and filthy. The hotel is very noisy and seems to be right next to a main train line as trains were thundering past all the time. Avoid this place at all costs.

They have exposed brick and beams, track lighting on a dimmer switch, non-ugly carpet, modern bathroom/vanity area, and sooo important for older buildings: good water pressure in the shower! Tempurpedic beds - some may not like that - we didn't mind. No complaint with cleanliness. However, we did put the card out to request new sheets one day and didn't get them. Staff is generally good. One guy provided a great recommendation for a place to get delivery dinner on a night my boyfriend hurt is back and we couldn't walk around too much. The continental breakfast does the job. Cereal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, juice, and various breads/pastries. Waffle station, but we didn't see anyone attempt to use it. Available till 11 on the weekends and 10 weekdays. We did have some noise issues carrying in from the street, but not bad. More annoying was the yappy dog in the room two doors down. We finally called the front desk around 1am and they confirmed they are pet free hotel and would send security. Whether or not they did, we're not sure. And would guess the owners were probably still out clubbing so not much the staff could have done anyway outside of kidnap the dog. But it did eventually quiet down, for whatever reason, and we think they checked out the next day. Note: the Carriage Courtyard is where the breakfast room is located. We peeked in one room while it was being cleaned and they do look really nice as well, but you might get foot traffic noise from people going to and from the breakfast area.",

The front desk were most helpful we had arrived very late after a delayed flight but they could not do enough for us. Also when asked about trips etc. The hotel was advertised as bed only but the complimentary breakfast was more than adequate and beautifully fresh. A real bonus.

A great breakfast with the staff being very friendly and gracious. Our room was superb, top floor, modern and very comfortable. We slept great every night and loved the over sized bathtub. It's on a canal so water taxi took us right to the hotel. The hotel arranged a Murano trip for us, with a nice water taxi, which was free. The Glass Gallery had lovely pieces which were very spendy and there is a bit of a hard sell but overall very enjoyable. The wifi cost euros, but that seems to be the standard in most of the nicer hotels. My fave hotel of the three big cities we stayed in.",

        "content": "The Encore property is beautiful. The strip-view room I had was quite spacious. There were no noise issues as some have mentioned from outside. The downfall came in service. The front desk was generally reluctant to answer questions and the workers there seemed cold and unfriendly. The only employees who seemed particular friendly were the housekeeping staff. Not what I would have expected from what is trying to be a 5 star hotel. Since many people (myself included) realize that the hotel is a good value for a room but the prices are high in other respects, I have a few suggestions on saving on the extras: (1) Taxi from the airport: always tell the driver to take Paradise Road. If not, once he hears Encore (or Wynn) he will likely take you on the highway and it will double the cost. (2) Water/snacks: walk to 7-11 about 1-2 blocks north of Encore on same side of street. Caveat: the area is not as nice as most of the strip south. Upside: bottled water for $1 instead of $8 in the hotel room. (3) Fashion mall: across from Encore/Wynn. Starbucks for breakfast is half the price of the cafe in the hotel. Also, Sushi Ra has good half price sushi from 5 - 7pm. (4) Boarding pass: Encore/Wynn lets you print it for free in their business center instead of paying their usual $1 per minute internet rate.",

It was our first stay at this resort and I have to admit that it is one of the best resort/casinos in Las Vegas. The rooms were nicely appointed, the beds were comfortable, pillows were super soft and the comforters were suple. Our check-in process went well and the staff at the front desk were courteous and carried themselves in a professional manner. The Encore's pool area is one of the nicer pools in Las Vegas - they provide nice thick and newer towels and you can get poolside service as wait staff is always inquiring if you needed anything at that time. There's a European pool area with a pool bar and gaming tables such as blackjack and craps - so you can cool down at the pool, have a drink at their bar and play some games at your own leisure. I like the accessiblity of the hotel to the Fashion Show mall which is right across the street from it and being at the heart of the strip - accessing other casinos was not a problem. We will definitely be back!",

For such a highly rated hotel however, the service is relatively poor. I arrived at the hotel in an oversized vehicle and was advised that the Wynn would account for the parking. This wasn't a hassle as the Wynn is next door. However on arrival at the Wynn, we were sitting in our vehicle and told to wait by hotel staff (approx 30 mins) for them only to tell us to go back to the Encore and park their. Cutting the long story short, we wanted a quick check in after a long journey and it took us over an hour overall to be instructed on where to park. Furious at this point, we proceeded to make a complaint at check in only to be told that the manager could not speak to us. When we were finally spoken to, we were given very little compensation at firsat but were eventually given $100 worth of food coupons and late check out... The maid service is poor and we had to phone twice on a 3 night stay and request they clean our rooms. However despite the above, the hotel design and its facilities are amazing and i certainly would recommend it to anyone seeking an opulant Vegas experience. If you do arrive in an RV...GOOD LUCK!!!",

Room is clean and everything works, including a fridge and microwave. Climate control is fairly new, quiet and in good working order. This is a great place to rest after a busy day in Branson, especially if you are searching for an inexpensive hotel. My room had two queen beds, TV with hutch, luggage rack, 3' square table with 2 chairs, basic bathroom, and adequate lighting. The room is a lot like you would find in an older-generation Holiday Inn (except the beds are NICE and the carpets are clean at this hotel).

My flights to Sydney (today) were cancelled this afternoon due to the ash clouds passing over the air space. This was extremely inconvenient and has messed up many of my business plans. Fortunately, I have one thing less to worry about with GSH. I called the Great Southern Hotel, hoping for a refund although I was aware of their cancellation policy (I should note that I was rather impolite and pushy, but they put up with me and were very patient). Their staff recited their policy as I had expected. A couple of hours later however, Donald from GSH called me to tell me that a refund or change of dates was on the way. This is fantastic service. The staff at GSH really know how to treat customers to keep them coming back. Mind you, they are very strict with their cancellation policy, but in my case, with such unfortunate circumstances, they understood and made my life much much easier!",

On checking in we were confronted by a notice saying that there was a 2% surcharge on credit cards. In all our years of business travel, we have hardly ever been charged a surcharge and certainly not 2%. The room was not inspiring - no artwork or anything to break the monotony. The toiletries consisted of one minuscule soap, a combo shampoo/conditioner (1 measly bottle) which left our hair feeling like straw, a shower cap and tissues. There was no mini bar - you had to venture down to reception to purchase anything. The room had no compendium or any hotel information at all. Pillows were uncomfortable. We paid for breakfast vouchers, and what a disappointment - slimy eggs with uncooked white slopping around, anaemic baked beans, the most horrible sausages we have ever tasted, and something that looked like bacon but may not have been. I was woken up the day BEFORE checkout by a call from reception telling me that we had an outstanding balance. We were quite aware of this (internet use, breakfast vouchers) and would have settled as usual on checkout. Why we had to be disturbed and told this is a mystery. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.",

It's a good hike above a backpackers in quality, in the backpacker district. The rooms aren't by any means designer, but for the money they're clean and do the job, reasonably quiet. Right out the back is MarketCity, for healthy brekkies. The restaurant is of the steak and chips school, so dinner at MarketCity might be a better health choice :-) Overall I enjoyed my stay here, and found it an excellent base for exploring Sydney on my own coin (although would go a little more upmarket if there on business).",

As usual, we had a top-notch experience at World Quest. The staff is very friendly, and the rooms have always been impeccably clean. We especially like the tiled floors and always select a 3 bedroom unit. We had stayed at more traditional hotels in prior years but found that for essentially the same price, we are able to stay in a condo unit and have a much more comfortable experience. It is essentially a \"home away from home\", complete with a full kitchen and washer/dryer. The kids especially like the large pool. It's kept very clean, and my wife and I like to sit in the shade and sip drinks from the Tiki Hut bar. I highly recommend World Quest to anyone!",

Pros * screened balcony allows you to enjoy the balcony at all hours without worrying about pesky bugs getting into your unit * close to EVERYTHING, e.g. Walmart, restaurants, SeaWorld, Disney, Premium Outlet (Vineland Ave.) * free breakfast (which you can take up to your room) * big pool (albeit a bit cold) * quiet units * heater that worked (it dipped to -6 Celsius one evening) * great for families or big groups Cons * perhaps because we were in one of the original buildings (building #2), it was a bit \"tired\" ... but this wasn't a deal breaker given the value proposition (we used a Facebook promotion code) * two lightbulbs burned out and we twice requested that maintenance come up to replace the bulbs but they never did make the trip to our unit Would I stay again?

The location for us as a family was perfect, over the busiest period of the year. We decided not to stay at one of the resort hotels due to the fact they would be extremely busy and enough time could be spent in queues during the day at Disney. Although The WorldQuest Resort was full over Xmas, you wouldn't have known it. The standards were as high as the rest of the year. We did spend a couple of days by the pool, and this was fairly quiet as alot of people we at the theme parks. There is a small bar which has a limited menu, but for the occasional meal is fine. We didn't use the shuttle provided by the resort to get us to the theme parks, but used a taxi instead - we could then come and go as we pleased. Sweet cakes etc for breakfast didn't suit us, so it is worth ensuring you make a trip to the local supermarket for supplies if you are the same. The condo's are excellent. We had a two bedroomed suite, which had lots of space and made for a really enjoyable stay. All things considered, price, location and service - I would say that you would struggle to find better in the area. One last thing - the concierge service is available from 7am each morning where you can buy your park tickets. Emily - very helpful! We would definately consider booking again.",

My husband was travelling for business last year and I attended a work conference this year and all of us had a great time. We would all enthusiastically recommend it to all.",

Housekeeping services are a la carte and we opted only for fresh towel exchange at $5/day. As we stayed only 3 nights we had to pay an end of stay cleaning fee of $39. The complementary continental breakfast was fine with four cereals, muffins, danish, bagels, toast, coffee. Seating was scarce at times.

        "content": "We were 3 adults with 2 teenagers going to Orlando for the theme parks. We booked these appartments through Jetsave, they were an alternative to a villa or hotel rooms. They were reasonably priced, so we weren't expecting too much. When we arrived the staff were friendly and proffesional. Our appartment was huge, it had 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms - the master ensuite had a massive shower, a jacuzzi bath and two sinks! The kitchen had everything you would need to cook and eat everynight if you wanted, with a washing machine and tumble drier.We also had a large balcony overlooking the pool area. This was very nice but the pool was open till 11pm and sometimes groups arrived late and headed straight for the pool, while we were in bed. We had some maid service included in our package, so the beds were made towels were changed and the dishwasher filled and started for us. We were disappointed to find out that the maid did NOT clean or bleach the toilets. It is ideally situated for all the parks, literally 5 minutes from Disney. (It's right behind the Nickelodeon hotel) The pool was always spotlessly clean, with clean towels always available. There was a complimentary breakfast thrown in, it is not up to much, but you could eat there every day for free, so who would complain about it? Overall this is a very good resort. Not as big and isolated as a villa, but with all the benefits of self-catering. I would stay there again- no question!",

        "content": "We had a great time at the WorldQuest resort. I was impressed with the condo-style rooms, large living area and kitchen. We (family of 4) had a 3 bedroom 2 bath condo and shared it with my sister's family of 5 and grandparents - so three families total. The condo was big enough for all, I only wish we had 3 bathrooms since we had to share with the grandparents. The kitchen was well stocked with at least one of everything we needed (except specialty things like rice cookers) and we cooked quite a few dinners there. It also had dishwashing detergent and dishsoap which was nice. The only problem we encountered was that with \"limited housekeeping\" they did not check toilet paper and replace it. This seemed to be strange and I wonder if we had called and requested if they would have supplied these necessities. My mother just bought replacements. The website lists a surcharge for wireless internet service. However, there was free internet access through a cable at the counter/bar area of the kitchen. This served our needs nicely and we thought this was a nice unexpected free service. The location was as good as any other we saw in the area. It was right behind the Nickelodian resort and easy to find after your first visit. The lobby area was nice and we enjoyed the free breakfast a few mornings. It was good quality food, but limited to starches (pastries and bagels), cereal and milk, and apples along with coffee and juice. My only suggestion would be to add filtered water - only water available was from the sink in the prep area. We were in building 6 which was a considerable walk (maybe 5 minutes) from the lobby - especially when you're trying to get everyone ready and out the door - so we only ate the free breakfast when we took the shuttle and were going to the lobby area anyways. I saw plenty of folks filling grocery bags with bagels and apples to take back to their rooms. We ended up buying cereal and milk and having that in our room most of the mornings to save time. I used the gym facilities a few times and while small it contained everything I needed for my workout including a few treadmills, free weights and yoga mats. It also had TV's available and towels. Filtered water was available here and I once I found that out I got my water for breakfast here - it's just down the hall. The pool itself was very nice. I wish the heat had been turned up since it was VERY cold when first entering. But we warmed up to it soon and had a blast! The hot tub was a little dirty in my opinion but much warmer then the pool (but not super hot). Tripadvisor was lacking any info on the free shuttle, so I kept our info sheet to post for posterity. Here is the info: - Reserve a shuttle and pick up a boarding pass from the guest services/ticket area in their \"marketplace\" at least 15 minutes prior to departure on the same day. This gives them the opportunity to try to sell you tickets which are actually a good rate (cheaper then gate prices when we checked into it). - Shuttles to Epcot depart at 9:20 am, 11:30 am, 1:20 pm. Then you have to use Disney's internal (free) transportation to the other parks. The free shuttle was \"average\" - a smaller bus that fit approx. 50 people. - Shuttle picks up right outside the lobby area - past the covered pull-through area - you have to be waiting and watching for it or it might not stop. They were mostly on time for the two days we used it. - Worldquest was their last stop so while you got a direct ride to the park, you also run the risk of having to stand or not being allowed boarding since it's full. We had an especially hard time taking a double stroller - there was just no room for it besides in the passenger seat at the front of the bus. The drivers were very nice but want to be tipped for their effort. One had the whole bus sing happy birthday to my 2-year-old on the way to the park which I thought was very nice - and of course he got a tip! - We found the free shuttle to be effective, however when taking the earliest available shuttle we still arrived in the parks one hour after opening - and anyone familiar with Disneyworld knows the first hour in the park is the most important since it's the least crowded. So most of the other days we just paid for parking to get full advantage of that extra hour. - Same for the return: you loose time in the park if you use the shuttle. Return from Epcot was 6:30 pm, 8:45 pm, and last shuttle was 10:30 pm. They made it clear that these were the DEPARTURE times and that if you weren't there on time they would leave without you. Since the Magic Kingdom closed after 11 pm each night, if you took the shuttle you don't get to see the night-time parade, the fireworks and spend that extra time in the parks. And remember that it takes at least 30 minutes to get back to the Epcot area from the other parks, taking away more valuable time. - Good thing about the return trip: you're the first hotel dropped off = short trip back. Which is nice at the end of a long day. - Another disadvantage of the shuttle is that you can't come back to rest in the middle of the day when it's very crowded and your kids need a nap. No return to hotel until 6:30 pm and no departures to Disney in the afternoon/evening. - Would I use the free shuttle again? Probably not. Unless: I didn't care about getting there at gate opening, I didn't have a large stroller, I didn't want to return to my hotel for a nap in the afternoon, and I didn't mind returning before the evening festivities. My mom was happy to use the shuttle since all of this applied to her. It just wasn't for my little \"disney-crazy\" family. Overall I was happy with our stay. I just won't factor in the free shuttle or free breakfast when doing the cost comparison with other hotels. If it's still a good deal without that stuff then I'd stay here again in an instant!",

We were in building 4 which was a short walk to the clubhouse and bus stop. We walked to the clubhouse daily for breakfast (muffins, bagels, toast, cereal, juices, coffee). You can also buy your park ticket there. We had no trouble with the bus. It was only a few minutes late on a few days. It really beat having to drive to the parks. The only negative about riding the bus is that we could not stay for the fireworks at each park because the last bus to the resort left at 10:30. All staff members we encountered were very polite and friendly. We enjoyed coming back to relax each night after a long day at the parks. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. You will love it!",

It was more than a great condo....Very very spacious and very clean with a typical American furniture. It has jaccuzi in the master bathroom. You really feel you are at home. The location is very close to Disneyworld but it can be bit difficult to reach especially at night. If you get lost, just ask for Nickelodeon hotel and it is very close to it. They have a great swimming pool and a nice gardens. It has a small supermarket and there is an outlet just outside the resort. This is the ideal place to stay if you travel with your family and don't want to spend too much staying at the very expensive Disney resorts. It is the ideal place to stay especially for a long holiday in Orlando...You can use the internet for free from your condo and you will have a free parking outside your door.... I loved this place and for sure will stay here again.",

It is off the strip across from the Las Vegas Hilton if any of you know where that is. We always rent a car so getting to the strip and around was okay for us. The free buffet breakfast was nice. Nothing elaborate but more than enough. Eggs, Bacon, Potatoes, Oatmeal, Cereal etc..... The price for the hotel was good and I would stay there again if I didn't want to stay in a Casino hotel or needed to save a few bucks but I usually stay at the huge hotels on the strip.",

We could see the view of the nearby golf course and the bright lights of the Las Vegas strip from a distance from our room. We felt safe and liked the idea of having a security pass to even get to our floor; this prevents people from just walking around. The hotel is very quiet in the evenings. The pool on the roof top was a treat, especially the beautiful views of all Las Vegas. We also enjoyed the very delicious breakfast buffet each morning. The free parking in a well lighted and secure parking garage is also a plus. I will definately stay again at this location and recommend it to all.",

Hopefully not from the housekeeping staff. Our room was 62 degrees when we got there and we never could figure out how to raise the temperature. We had just come from the Renaissance Resort near Seaworld where we spent $111.00 a night for a room that was twice as large, with a sofa and chairs, dining area, wet bar and office area. Plus, everything in the Renassance is right there - restaurants, bars, pool. No long walks required.",

I've stayed at the several Disney properties and this would be the one I would least likely return to. But again, it may be because of the smaller kids.

For other meals, we had to go to another hotel or one of the parks.That seems to me absolutely ridiculous. The hotel was clearly overbooked andnot worried over their guestsÂ´well-being. For the sort of price you pay there, I felt definitely cheated. They should not fill to overflowing, making it imposible for their own guests to have a meal inside the hotel. And more: I asked once to use an internet, which I imagined I would have to pay at some business center. Front desk told me where to go - it was closed and I was told to use the one at the Contemporary, where we had had dinner three nights. Well, I will stay elsewhere next time...",

The bathroom was large and the robes and coffee maker provided a sense of luxury. The heated pool was inviting, although we never had time to take a dip. There were plenty of people indulging, and even though the pool is open 24 hours and our room faced the pool, it was never loud. We were in the Boca Chica building, which was at the back of the property, overlooking the beach and the pool. Our daughter looked forward to the chocolates provided with the turn down service. The location was convenient. It was fastest to take the Monorail to the Magic Kingdom (no stops) and the boat back (no stops). The monorail from the MK back to the GF had 4 stops before the hotel. We ate at the cafe for breakfast twice, and it was tasty and had the wonderful friendly Disney Service.",

The hotel is very lovely and takes one back to the elegance of the turn of the century. Staff was exceptional to Disney standards. Multiple restaurants on the \"pricey\" side. This was a trip for our Grandson and although the hotel very nice, probably not overall the best selection of a Disney luxury property on the Monorail for a seven year old. The lobby is gorgeous complete with high tea and a full orchestra in the afternoon and evening. The grounds are gorgeous with multiple pools; one with a sandy beach. Great access to the Magic Kingdom; the first stop going on the Monorail and first stop returning on the boat. One evening we ate in the casual Grand Floridian Cafe where they have display drawings done by youngsters while waiting for dinner. My husband inquired if they would display our Grandson's for just a short time giving him the opportunity of being the \"Artist of the Day\". It was a highpoint in his trip. We were in the Conch Key Building on the fifth floor in a gabled room with balcony. The room was generous in size with a king bed and sofa making into a single bed, flat screen TV, clock radio/alarm with IPod feature and large desk and work table. The bath has first class amenity shampoos and lotions with double sinks and separated from the toilet and tub/shower combination. Each building also had a small laundry room with two washers and two dryers. I learned in Florida, since we shared our visit with Tropical Storm Fay, it is better to have a property mainly contained in one building rather than one with multiple buildings. One could get pretty drenched walking from the main building and the Monorail stop to the Conch Key building where our accommodations were located. Overall, we would return but probably not with a small child and would look at either the Polynesian or Animal Kingdom.",

The electronic door keys have known problems (extraordinarily inconveniencing after a day at park) - It defeats convenience of a quick return from the park to your room. No sound proofing between rooms. Only basic channel options for the television, the internet is slow, costs extra and isn't wireless. Food is standard Disney fare but at higher prices and even expensive meals have no table cloth. Finally, it seems to get higher ratings than deserved. The Gaylord Palm near Celebration could never have these issues and get its high rating. I think there were a lot of times when the desk/GF management/WDW management just didn't feel it was necessary to fix blatant problems. I strongly suggest visitors snap pictures of exactly what you find wrong and uncorrected and post them here upon return home. Unfortunately I didn't think to do that at the time, I kept thinking each thing would be the last and I should just focus on enjoying the trip as a whole. Finally, read through the recent 3 and 4 star review texts, the content is more accurate of the hotel and I don't see how people gave it 3 or 4 except maybe some categories brought the average higher than reality.",

This is a beautiful property that is very secure and in a perfect location to enjoy all the fun of Mardi Gras and the beautiful city. First the positives. We were on the parade route with a view out the front window onto Canal. The hotel provides you with a wrist band to show so that non-guests are not allowed in. We saw several people being turned away at the door. We liked that security was tight. The lobby is on the 3rd floor and you have to change elevators to get to the room floors. Added to the security element I guess, but it was a little annoying. Our room was ready at 3 PM as promised although we saw many people who were waiting well after 6 pm for their rooms. Our king room was not big - and the bath area is completely seperate - which was nice but it makes the room feel even smaller. The room decor was identical to that pictured on the website. The bedding is very nice with a feather bed on the mattress - comfortable! Our one window was large with a great view of Canal St. There is a TV, mini bar, large desk and a comfortable chair. Plenty of drawer space for a long stay if you need it. Bathroom amenities were Bulgari. The room and carpet were very clean - even the outside windows had been recently cleaned! The entire lobby smelled of fresh Gardenia - ahhhh and the lobby floral arrangements were stunning! Cabs are not plentiful in New Orleans right now. We had trouble getting cabs more than once. We managed one to Commander's Palace for Sunday Brunch, but we never even thought to ask him to return to get us. We ended up walking all the way back to the hotel (almost 3 miles) which wasn't a bad idea after a big brunch - but I could have used other shoes to make the trip! One cabbie told us there are only 1/3 of the cabs left in town that were there before Katrina. The Ritz is a 1 block walk to Bourbon St. It is on the very end of Bourbon, which is a great location - still on the outside but close enough. It seems as though most of NOLA is headed in a positive direction. Once again we were treated to great southern hospitality and met very friendly people. The staff of the Ritz was pleasant, but not overly stuffy. My guess is that people who have negative opinions of the service here are used to getting fussed over a bit more (spoiled?). We saw a nice demonstration of that at the front desk as a man threw a fit that he needed help with his bags immediately because his \"private jet\" was due to leave asap! Whatever dude! We found the service to be excellent - especially during the busiest time of year. The hotel was spotless and if you weren't in town to celebrate Mardi Gras this would be the place to stay - it was downright quiet even though the hotel was very full. I would stay here again if the price was right, but I don't know if I will ever find the great deal that we had again!",

        "content": "I just returned from a trip to New Orleans and was somewhat disappointed by the Ritz Carlton. I can't say that anything especially bad happened to me when I was there, it's just that the service was not up the Ritz standards. I travel a fair bit for work and usually stay in Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons and I like this hotel less than any other Ritz I've stayed in. I thought the decor of my room was pretty horrifying. There was dark Victorian-looking wallpaper with matching drapes and near matching comforter. Suffice it to say that it was not my thing stylistically. Also, there was hair on the shower walls in the bathroom (not a lot but enough to make you wonder about how thoroughly the rooms are cleaned). The service was pretty good but just not as crisp as a typical Ritz. For example, when I called down to get my car brought up the morning of my departure, the attendant's answer was \"gotcha covered.\" I didn't think that was especially appropriate. Finally, once I got downstairs 10 minutes after calling, the car still hadn't been brought up. I had to wait another 5 minutes. Maybe that would have been understandable if it was busy, but this was 5am and no one was around. Until I find a better hotel in NO, I'd probably stay there again but would certainly lower my expectations.",

        "content": "We just returned from visiting the Ritz for our 20th anniversary. As I'm originally from Pascagoula, MS, I was anxious about seeing how New Orleans was rebuilding (lives as well as buildings). Many thanks to all of you who posted encouragement to visit, you were right...it welcomes visitors with open arms. I'll try to be concise with my info, so here goes. Where we ate: Breakfast at the Club Level-light stuff, fruit, berries, etc. which was good, considering our other meals. Lunch-Masperas (sp?) one day as I was scouring the city for a soft-shelled crab po-boy. Hot and hungry, settled for a shrimp sandwich (po-boy like, but on a bun) and it was good. The line outside cracked me up-all these cranky and hot people waiting to get in-you feel like you've won the lottery to get in AC. Other lunch-New Orleans School of Cooking which is in the quarter, 2 1/2-3 hrs., good food, very entertaining. Loved their jambalaya, bread pudding and pralines but the gumbo was just soso as they had to make it in less than 4-6 hrs. Dinners-the hotel restaurant. Crab trio was great, filet with crab was good, hubby's was so bad he had to complain (very unusual as he'll eat most anything). Great jazz band in there, preceded by a female singer who was also good. Also went to Commander's Palace. The BEST service I've received that I can remember, ever. Very reasonable ($39 for appetizer/entree/dessert!)-started with the waiter's suggestion of crawfish something-it was divine. Hubby said the turtle soup was good, not great. He regularly eats it at the Brennans in Houston which he prefers. Entrees were soft-shelled crab prepared with some other stuff-I'm sorry I can't remember. The crab was very good. DH had a fish dish that had crabmeat which he loved. The dessert...I truly have never tasted better cheesecake in my entire life! They make their own cream cheese! Hubby had the praline parfait but couldn't stay out of my cheesecake. We had the rest wrapped up to fit in the little fridge. It was that good. The hotel: Smells WONDERFUL! Beautiful flowers, great service (although they forgot turndown both nights), nice bathrooms with separate toilet area, nice furniture in the rooms, and frette linens!!! Slept like a baby... Other things we did: lots of walking around, antiquing, looking at art, took a nice carriage ride and got to see a funeral! You must see a New Orleans funeral! The band plays jazz (happy or sad, depending on the direction they're going) and the mourners follow it, carrying umbrellas. It was so moving, we got out of the carraige to pay our respects. I know this probably doesn't sound very action packed to most of you, but we really needed to relax this weekend. We did walk around with a 'hand grenade' which was a green drink in a silly glass. Thats always fun. And we spent Sunday morning watching Nadal beat Federer...again! Thanks for reading and please don't hesitate to visit NOLA. Yes, its hot (just like Houston), and yes, some areas you don't want to venture down-like empty streets, but we truly never felt unsafe. Oops, not so concise, but I tried",

        "content": "I have to start by saying that the following stay occured during the weekend before Mardi Gras. With that said, when we arrived at the hotel at 3 o'clock in the afternoon we were first told our room was ready, then it would a few minutes, so they would buy a drink, very nice. After an hour we were told, someone else actually had our room, so it would be a few more minutes. I should interject here, that some of the staff were very poorly trained and acted as if we were inconviencing them because they were so busy. We were told to go to the lounge and wait they would call us on our cell phone. Finally at 5:30, 2 and 1/2 hours after we arrived, we went back to the registation desk. The woman said, \"We have plenty of rooms in the club section, we will upgrade you\". But what she meant was we will put you in club level and charge you more. It was an extra $150 per night. We were tired from our flight and said fine. So finally after now 3 hours we were about to get to a room. Here is the kicker, when we got to the room it was occuppied. I mean, the bell boy, actually opened the door, we walked in and someone was in there! Finally got a room 3 and 1/2 hours after arriving. By the way, many other people had to wait for their rooms and we were told they were short staffed for cleaning rooms. I'd like to assume that my experience was due in part to Mardi Gras, problems finding staff in the wake of Katrina, and a hotel being renovated. ROOM Nice bed, but suprisingly a regular TV, 24 inch, limited cable. Great bathtub and a menu of exotic baths they will prepare for you. Bulgari bathroom amenities. High speed internet, but they charge you an additional $12.95 on top of the $500 plus a night they are already getting during Mardi Gras for a club level room. CLUB LOUNGE While they state 5 \"tastings\" or meals, in reality there is only 5 on Friday & Saturday. The other days it is really only 4, in fact the 4th or last of the day is simply drinks and some desserts. Overall I'm not sure if the club level is worth the extra money, in our case about $150 extra per night on top of a standard room for around $350 during Mardi Gras. In addition, it should be noted that getting to the club level requires 2 elevators and a walk. To get to your room requires a 3rd elevator. They claim a new elevator direct to the street will be open in April, so that should no longer be an issue. LOCATION While you are close to Bourbon St. and the French Quarter, it is not in the safest area of New Orleans. Be careful at night near the hotel and DO NOT WALK THE WRONG WAY UP CANAL ST. If you've been drinking, take a taxi back to the hotel. Also, always ask taxi drivers to turn on their meters. New Orleans taxi drivers are notorius for ripping off their fares. CONCIERGE We had really wanted to go to Jaces Imo's restrurant. We asked the concierge to make a reservation and she simply said it is closed. I would've expected another recommendation at least. Granted she was busy, but hey I thought this was the Ritz Carlton and they could handle Mardi Gras with their usual high level of service. They certainly knew how to charge at a high level.",

This time, my experience was not a very good one and I am very disappointed. The New Orleans Ritz-Carlton has to many flaws to justify a high classification of a top ranked luxury hotel. The rooms do not seem to be in a very good shape. The carpet in my room had many stains, and it looked like it need a proper cleaning. My room was also very noisy, letting me hear lots of disturbing noises from the street and from the rooms next to mine. Most of the hotel staff (housekeeping, room service, front desk) did not act very professional and seem to lack training. My recent New Orleans Ritz-Carlton experience was terrible in comparison to other Ritz-Carlton hotels, and well below the high service standard it normally offers under this flag.",

However, my stay last week in New Orleans left a little to be desired. Four days later, I stayed at the Holiday Inn in Historic Charleston and received twice the service at half the price. And yes, part of that was based on expectations. My stay at the Ritz was off-kilter by a stained carpet, red wine or ?, my room charge going up by $40 mid-week, stuffy front desk staff, and a focus on exceeding the expectations of not me, but other people. The spirit is there, but the delivery is a little weak at this hotel. I'll try again and hopefully, they will try harder.",

        "content": "We stayed in an Executive Suite on a recent four day trip to New Orleans. The suite appeared perfect initially then we discovered an unclean bathroom facility and waited two days for a special request from housekeeping. Despite the rocky start the service for the most part was up to Ritz-Carlton standards though turn down was skipped one night. The lack of a swimming pool was a disappointment in the August heat of New Orleans. There always seemed to be security personnel around the entrances to both the Ritz and the Maison-Orleans during the day. At night there was no visible security. We had to report an obvious intrusion by a New Orleans \"less fortunate\" into the Maison elevators at 2 am to a befuddled night guest service person. The person wandering around was harmless and simply looking to gain access..but this was not reassuring about the hotel security concerns. All the personnel were friendly and helpful until departure when my traveling companion was instructed to find a taxi on Canal Street upon departure. I can say I amazed the Ritz in New Orleans has maintained its 5 star 5 diamond ratings. I wrote an email to management concerning both praise and a couple of the problems. I am happy to say I was answered promptly, courteously and in writing. For that reason I will return to the Ritz in New Orleans. Otherwise the Windsor Court would get my business in the future.",

We arrived in the evening and a gentleman met us as we got out of the taxi with our keys. The room we were in had a door facing Royal street on the 1st floor. Yes, the furniture was old. Yes, the decorations were old. Yes, it smelled a little musty. But it was a great experience. There aren't big frills like Room Service and Mini Bars, but there is a kitchen with a full size refrigerator, coffee maker, adequate shower and bathroom facility, beautiful antique decorations, and most of all a true New Orleans experience. The one staff member that met us was available when we needed him for an iron, directions, and general friendly conversation. I agree that if you're looking for somewhere fancy look elsewhere, but if you're interested in a room with charachter that is literally one block from Bourbon street and walking distance of everything you need, this is the place.",

The location was excellent - right on the Inner Harbor and close to the Baltimore Aquarium, Camden Yards, and the local areas of interest (Little Italy, Fells Point). The room was nice and quiet. They even had a complimentary 'crabby hour' each night where a snack was made and wine/beer was provided. My only complaint was the $9.95 activity fee that was charged for each night stayed. I wasn't aware of the fee before we checked in. Overall great stay.",

The hotel is absolutly gorgeous! The staff were extremely friendly. The room was AMAZING! It was so very modern, the color sceme in our room was gold and purple, and even the bathroom was gorgeous -much different than your typical hotel bathroom. The bed was very, very comfortable as were the couch and chair. I wanted to take the chair home with us! Avoid eating at the hotel's cafe. The breakfast there was awful. Don't bother purchasing a package deal either with the hotel. It's not worth the extra money and I found the breakfast coupons to be a total waste of money since no food was really offered with them. If you want to splurge stay here. We probably won't stay there again because it was very expensive for our means, but worth the night we spent.",

If we hadn't been allowed to park in the Americana parking lot across the street while it's undergoing renovations, it would have been a nasty inconvenience to have to walk three blocks away across a busy street to get back and forth from the car. The porch was nice, rocking chairs were comfortable, and the breeze felt good. I was dismayed at first about not having a beach view from our room, but that soon faded when I realized what other places in the area were charging. Good thing we were there during the \"off\" season, or it might have seemed a bit cramped.",

        "content": "There are some good things and some bad things about this hotel. First the good: The hotel has a great location. It is located just steps from the boardwalk. It is the second building from the boardwalk which means it doesnt face it but you can see it from the hotels front porches that feature chairs. The managment is on site. The owners ( a husband and wife - although you deal with the wife) live on site. They take up the first floor of the three story hotel so if you need something you can ask them. Then the bad: There are no elevators and so you will have to walk up stairs that are outside with your bags. The rooms and the lobby are on the 2nd and 3rd floors because the owners live on the first floor. Many of the hotels in Ocecan City and even on the boardwalk feature on site parking. This is not one of them. There is a parking lot that is located 3 blocks away (across a very busy road). Another option though is on street parking. There are some spaces in the city that you do not have to pay for and can park for days on end and are very safe which I used my entire stay. I was able to find spaces three times. Since the hotel does not face the boardwalk the side of the hotel has views of the boardwalk. The boardwalk area is very dense so there is another row of buildings between the hotel and the boardwalk so room views arent that great. Overall this hotel was pretty good....it was not that expensive. The hotel is in a great location (there is a hotel across the street and a B&B next to it) so if you can live with the little quirks its worth a try.",

The room was a bedsit, the furniture old and stained, the bedroom unbelievably small. The wallpaper was peeling and there were holes in them (the walls). There has been no attempt at renovation/updating in about 30 years. For the money this place is a ripoff. The final straw came when I realized I'd left my phone charger behind and called their reception he same day I checked out, but only got their voicemail service. I told them I would return in 2 weeks to collect. hen I called in, guess what? yes the receptionist had his takeout meal half eaten in front of him. No one seemed to have a clue. The senior assistant said they had no procedure for lost property, but then said they usually posted out! This hotel is the pits and you should avoid at all costs.

They offer self-catering apartments in an excellent location. When we first got to the office, which is in a beautiful back bay location on West Newton Street, we were told that they had four different properties and they had upgraded us from a small studio to a medium studio, free of charge, which was at their location on St. Stephens st., a few blocks away. When we got to the place, we found out that we were in a basement studio in a great, little building on a beautiful street, near many of the places that we wanted to go to. Despited being a \"basement\" studio, we really weren't underground and the place actually had it's own private backyard, which was nice, even though we never did use it. The only drawback was the noise. We could hear the water dripping from upstairs constantly, but it wasn't a big deal for us. Some people might get really bothered by these kinds of things, but we realize that when we are travelling, things are bound to happen and for 120 dollars a night, we had absolutely no complaints.",

This place is in a very nice sector of Boston, close to public transportation and all the major hotels and the business area. First of all, you should know that the pictures on the Copley House website are pretty misleading. Actually, theyâ€™re very misleading! We â€“ my wife and two kids â€“ had booked a one-room unit, which is supposed to be the most luxurious one they have. Ouch! If you donâ€™t mind the missing paint on the walls, the moldy smell, the dirty carpets, the so-so beds and sofa beds, and the slimy showers (just to name a few â€œfeaturesâ€�), go ahead and ask for unit 100 in the basement of the 239 West Newton Street building... right next to the laundry room!! That being said, when we saw our unit, we asked to be moved and were given two separate rooms for the first night (11 & 14-year-old kids weren't too happy about sleeping in a different room that their parents, but it was better that being in the basement...), we then had to go back to our smelly basement on the second night, and we were given a nice one-bedroom unit for our third and last night. Thatâ€™s a lot of moving around for such a short trip! We were in Boston with a few other people who stayed in another building (first floor of St. Stephen Street building), and their rooms were fine. I think Iâ€™d go back to the Copley House because of its affordable prices and its tremendous location, but I would ask for specific rooms, i.e. rooms 104 (which has been completely renovated and which is very nice) and room 109 (a one-bedroom unit) in the 239 West Newton Street building. I would also stay away from room 103 (and 100 of course) in this same building. While I wasnâ€™t too impressed with the Copley House, I must say that the staff were all VERY helpful, understanding and accommodating. I really appreciate what they did to make our stay more enjoyable. Finally, they gave me a substantial rebate, which was also greatly appreciated.",

In fact, i had been go through some of the review, and understand that the room is small, but i just couldnt understand that why they treat me like idiot and keep mentioning that this is HK standard size double bed!! we have no choice as that was the peak season of HK and i believe i could not locate another hotel in the new year eve. However, it spoilt my new year mood, and my 2009 was started in a bad experience! U might find it is difficult to get the hotel as it is not reachable by MTR. However, you really enjoy the local life of Hong Kees. With the crowded wet and dry market, fruit stalls, and food stalls, we did enjoy ourselves throughout our stay. Further, the bus station is 2 minute walking distance from the hotel, easily reach causeway bay, central through the bus. what i want to mean is, it is not easy to find the hotel, but easy to go central those places from the hotel.",

Tons of storage space and the corner suite provided amazing views of the East River and NYC. The location was within pretty easy walking distance to museums, Central Park and subway stations. The furniture, including TV werenâ€™t new but they were very serviceable. On the down side, with all the windows and subway construction below, it was a bit noisy but youâ€™re in NYC after all. Also, the front desk wanted to charge us $35 per night to make up the sleeper couch but we pointed out that the reservation was clearly for 3 people and that there was no mention of the extra bedding charge when the reservation was made. They agreed to waive the charge without too much squabbling. Weâ€™ve stayed at other all-suite hotels in Manhattan and this was by far the best value of the bunch.

And the other staff were also committed to help with any questions or problems. Another great thing was the location point: very good! 3-4 blocks from Times Square! Close to everything! I did most things on foot. Now, points of improvement: cleaning the rooms. They were always dirty because the hotel never cleaned the floor. It had a lot of dirt, and hair from previous guests. The bed linen could also improve as comforters were old and very used. I found them too many hairs from other guests. We could pass a reform, it has many good things to offer. Overall I enjoyed staying there. It was a hotel used only to sleep. In short: excellent location, very friendly attendants and willing to help. But the room cleaning, linen, and conservation of the hotel were not good. If you are looking for a hotel with great location, just to sleep and with proper care, can stay there!",

The room was rather small but the bed was big and confortable; same with the bathroom, and everything looked reasonable clean. What I liked the most is the location next to 8th avenue; it is very close to times square but not overwellmed by the turists crouds, and 8 and 9th avenues have more authentic NY restaurants and bars and better prices that the times square area. My room was not facing the street and in was very quiet. I was recomended by the hotel staff (by phone) to park at the Central parking structure at 40th between 7 and 8th. !!!Be prepared to take all your luggage and things from the car as soon as you pull over, since they will park your car for you and you can not access it untill you take the car away!!!. They charged me $60 for 47 hours with a boucher I was given at the hotel desk. We had breakfast at a chinese bakery next to the hotel with real NY people. The coffee and the pastries were surprisingly good.",

However, there is a crossing point: precisely where this slum seemed to have leaped off the pylons of great hotels, creating a tourist-friendly New York stay into paralytic asphyxiation of horror. It looms precariously on it's two-star rating. The distraught condition of drug predators and illegals cramming their holed guts into the trickling walls probably purchased the minimal rating. To this corroded stature of suckitude, I may ask to command you a simple trot away, scorchingly applying pressure to the gas pedal. First off, the \"lobby\" is a tight and small space... just like the stairway/room/elevator. Our room had no form of heating in the brutal cold of Manhattan. The bathroom door did not lock, \"great\". The bed was FILTHY!! STAINS! STAINS! HAIR ON THE BED! My goodness... there is no standards for this dump. The doors have stains... i don't know what it is? Mold? Feces? Basically, the room we had checked in online for about half a week was canceled the first hour we were there and the whole hour we were there was trying to book another hotel.",

It was absolutely disgusting. AND...even though we walked in and walked right back out.....they would NOT refund our money. It was worth it to call hotels.com and find a great place at Broadway Plaza Hotel for only $10.00 more a night. I would stay very very far away.

WE were NOT told at the time of our booking they were in the middle of renovations. Courtesy would at least grant that and give us the choice. Hopefully they have changed their ways but after reading latest reviews perhaps not. Towels were dirty, bathroom floor was dirty and room was dirty. I had to clean the bath before I could use it. Bed was hard, bedding disgusting. Glad it was a brief trip. They tried to put us in a room that had just been painted and the window didn't open at first. Then we asked for another room which had patches of carpet on the floor. Forget this hotel if you are light sleeper, tile floors line the hallways and suitcases rolling on the floors are noisy as is anyone walking by. We were on a tight budget and had to be in NYC that day. For around $170 at the time what a rip off!!!! I will go without food and save money to stay in a decent place and thankfully we have since found other hotels better quality for a cheaper price. Oh and yes there is no elevator and if they didn't have my credit card number I would have left on arrival after seeing the foyer!",

We checked in took the elevator, which only held 3 small people to our room. The hall itself was so narrow two people had to take turns walking down them. Our room had no air on upon arrival, had to open the window to plug in the AC. In the room we had to take turns walking around because it was so small. We found smashed roaches on the wall, no soap, toilet lid, shampoo, no place to put toiletries in bathroom, had to ask for towels, looks to be like they had water leaks down the walls, had a dressing table but could not use it because the stool was between the table & bed and you could not pull out the stool. Make sure if you book here that your clothes are pressed unless you like ironing out in the hallway on attached to wall iron & board. NIGHTMARE!",

        "content": "I want to commend Hotel Le Marais on their hospitality, competence, reliability, efficiency and attentiveness regarding our hotel stay. From the beginning of our booking process earlier this year to the final checkout I have been very pleased with all stages and personnel. Shawn was excellent booking my room and giving me the room I requested. He was always cheerful and anxious to help The next day after we checked in, we overslept for breakfast and we came down to the front desk and explained that we have missed breakfast this morning and asked to the young lady who was working if we could get some fruit and yogurt. As fast as she could she ran to the kitchen and brought us oranges, apples, yogurt and amazingly she also included muffins, sausage patties with English muffins, milk and orange juice. Seriouslyâ€¦this is SERVICE!!! The type of service you donâ€™t find everywhere. She went above and beyond our expectations and if I remembered correctly her name was Daphneey. The room was clean and nice, with everything you could possibly need. The bar was awesome with candles lighting up in every table. Shawn and Alex at the bar were amazing. The heated outdoor pool was relaxing. My wife and I were really impressed with the overall appearance of the hotel, the staff and especially the comfort of the beds. Thank you Hotel Le Marais, your immediate staff, the front desk staff, to the housekeeping departmentâ€”each person made my wife and I feel welcomed, cared about and treated like a friend. We will definitely comeback again and again!!!!!",

They used cheap doors and you can hear right through them. While waiting for an elevator we could clearly hear a shower in one room and a whoopie session in another. The complimentary breakfast is lame. A few boxes of cereal and bagels laid out in the bar, not a service person to be seen.

While still undergoing the final touches of a massive renovation, this is a beautiful little gem right off of Bourbon Street. Upon arriving, parking can be a little tricky, as with all of the boutique hotels in the quarter. But valet was great. Lobby was small but very efficient, with the hotel lounge overlooking a stunningly beautiful courtyard, complete with a small pool. The rooms were very nice and stylish,. The beds were incredibly comfortable. LOVED the step in shower. Although no tub, the shower was great! And, even though you are less than a block off of Bourbon street, I couldn't hear any of the noise. This property is a real asset to the French Quarter and I would highly recommend it whether your going to the city for business or pleasure. Can't wait to stay again!!",

They have a few tables with beer taps at the table very cool. The bar is very modern and well stocked, if Abby is your bartender then your in for a treat, she is the best. Great staff and service. I stayed with my uncle and his friend booked the room and he did not know I was coming so when we asked for a room with two beds they had nothing available so they took some $$ of our bill and gave us two money vouchers towards the bar or restaurant. Great location a few blocks from bourbon street so you don't get all the noisy rift raft at night, and walking distance to Jackson square and the Frenchman. If Acme has a line 30 deep which it usually does go across the street to Felix's its better and is where the locals go, huge fresh oysters the best I have ever had.

The good news is that unlike most W's there was enough light for my aging eyes. The bad, the new decor is really terrible. Why didnt they keep it simple instead of painting the walls orange with an eyesore of a design as the focal point of the room and the ugliest carpet I have ever seen. Could have been amazing, now certainly comfortable, and the good part is you close your eyes at night and dont have to look up at the scary design above you.

The only available room was small and there wasn't even a comfortable chair in it. But at least it was at the rear of the total away from the construction noise and jackhammers. A stay at this W will probably be better after the construction is completed and, hopefully, the rooms are upgraded a bit. The extremely friendly and accommodating staff and great location in the French Quarter are reason enough for us to return to the W on our next visit (after renovations are completed).",

Recommend verifying up front if construction is still taking place and if so doing what you can to ensure you are not going to be affected by it.

There was a stocked refrigerator in the room. However, the prices of everything was outrageous. Needless to say, we didn't touch anything in the refrigerator. A bottle of water was $7.00 plus a 20% surcharge and 6.5% tax. The pool was beautiful, it had a nice waterslide. The water wasn't very deep. The deepest part of the pool was 4ft 6in. We stayed at the hotel for the fass passes and early access to Harry Potter. It was definitely worth it. Harry Potter reached maximum capacity by noon and with the fast passes we never had to wait to get on the rides. The location can't be beat if your going to the parks.",

With two teenage boys in tow, we opted for the Hard Rock Hotel. Our room was ready when we checked in (around 2pm) - clean and all in order. No problems with housekeeping during our stay. No problems with noise (we had a \"garden view\" room not facing the pool). Ate at The Kitchen for breakfast each day. A bit pricey but typical for resort restaurants. Food and service were good. Very easy walk to Citywalk and the two parks. Using your room key as Express Pass is the BEST benefit. We did not do the early AM entry to Harry Potter. Too many people do that so the lines wind up being long. During the regular hours we never waiting more than 30 mins. Priority seating at restaurants never was useful. Being able to charge to your room key is handy - especially when teens are on their own and need to purchase food. But watch out for limits as your cards get cut off if you exceed them. You need to work out limits with the front desk. Many restaurants in Citywalk give AAA discount so always ask. We used the Mears Shuttle from the airport. For a family I would not recommend it. Mears puts too many people in a van and makes too many stops. For a few bucks more, opt for the taxi.",

New room reeked of smoke and febreez in the smoke free hotel , not so good for a child with allergies. Jonathan was as genorous as he could be. After getting room service- it took 4 people over thirty minutes to get us a wine tool for the $70 bottle we had ordered. The food was freezing cold once it did arrive. When we called \"star service\", they repeatedly answered and hung up - or sent it to voicemail. Save your money. I wish I had. I have had better customer service at a gas station.

The hotel was perfect! extremely clean and well maintained, great food, a beautiful beach (which was a pleasant surprise being i was prepared for the \"lack of great beaches on key west\" as I was told) but it gave me my \"fix\" when i wanted to lay out. Ironically we found we only layed on our beach for 2 hours during the entire 3 days as we explored all the streets of key west. there's so much to see and so much to do. I owe a great thanks to all the wonderful people on tripadvisor, as the suggestions on things to do and see was spot on. We loved our bartender Brian who sadly is moving back home. he helped us a lot. I highly recommend renting the bicycles...it's a good way to explore the town and burn off the calories from the wine the night before! few key points: great small clean beach and clean beautiful water hotel provides computer to check-in online and print boarding pass service was EXTREMELY nice always greeting you hotel was VERY clean... location is PERFECT..steps from mallory square/sunset festival/ (Roof top cafe is great to eat at) VERY QUIET despite being on top of Duval street. I AM A LIGHT SLEEPER and I swear they must have installed sound proof glass! Enjoy all key west has to offer .....I underestimated how much fun it would be",

I was upstairs on the corner. I had two windows, one faced the pool the other faced the river. I was in Oak Manor near the bridge that is closest to the main facility. One night on the way back from Magic Kingdom we had just missed the bus to the Riverside resort, so we decided to take the bus to French Quarter and walk the path over. We weren't halfway there when a security guy picked us up in his golf cart and dropped us at the bridge that goes straight to our building. This trip was during the holiday season and the resort was decorated beautifully. I would definitely stay at this resort again. I highly recommend it to families. The food court was great. The prices were high, but you expect that at Disney. Although we did order a pizza at the food court to take back to the room and it only cost about 15.00. And that fed us all. We flew so we were sort of at the mercy of Disney prices as we didn't have a car to go off property. I would definitely recommend having a car if at all possible. We had a fridge in the room so if I'd had a car I could have gone to Walmart for lunch meat. But whatever, it was fun. The hotel was great. Again, I would recommend this resort.",

        "content": "There are two types of themed residential areas in this resort. The â€œAlligator bayou.â€� area has smaller accommodation blocks and an informal feel and atmosphere. The other region (called Magnolia Bend) is an impressive and formal deep south, old grand mansion, look and feel area. There is a (0.9 mile) walkway / cycle path which forms a loop around and across the Sassagoula river which runs through the center of the resort. The pathway has a link to through to the French Quarter resort. The path affords great views of the resort as you wander, jog or cycle around it. Depending on which accommodation you get you may get very familiar with the walkway as you trail back and forward to the food court. Aside from the theming the rooms are identical. The Alligator bayou rooms have (fake) log bed frames which are really easy to stub your toes on. (yep I speak from experience there.) The rooms are slightly bigger than an All Star Resort room and have a refrigerator and coffee making facilities. Other than that they are the same basic layout with the door at the front and the bathroom (with no window) at the rear. The room can be a little dark if the lights are switched off. (Why would you be in the room during the day anyway?) The air conditioning is a through the wall unit rather than a central type and it can be a bit noisy if you leave it on. (Itâ€™s Florida, you will probably leave it on.) There are some good swimming pools with the relaxed â€œOlâ€™ Man Islandâ€� pool having a water slide. All Pools at Disney are heated so you can swim all year round. Food court. The resorts reception, bars shop and restaurants are located in the â€œSassagoula Steamboat Companyâ€� building. There is service restaurant (Boatwrightâ€™s) and a general dining area (Riverside Mill) with a reasonable choice of food. Both are nicely themed. There is also a bar which serves snack food in the main building and a bar poolside on Olâ€™ Man Island. The shop has a limited choice of essential items and the usual large choice of Disney items. This is a nice calm and relaxed resort. It is a more grown up resort than All Star for not excessively more money. The grounds and general ambiance is superb and this makes the resort feel like it is a higher standard than the moderate grade it is afforded. I would not recommend this as a first choice for families with young children as it isnâ€™t quite as â€œDisneyfiedâ€� as other resorts. If you want a similar standard that is a little more kid entertaining go next door to French Quarter.",

This time we stayed in the Alligator Bayou rooms-which are exellant, and have a rustic feel; I liked these better than the Mansion rooms. The beds were very comfortable. The food court has many choices, one of my favorite is the Mickey waffle with strawberries. The gift shop is also great! One feature that keeps us coming to Port Orleans is their boat service to Downtown Disney. This is such a relaxing ride, and much better than taking the bus. It is also a short walk over to French Quarter. On evening we walked over to French Quarter and had a drink at their lounge (highly recommended is the Tropical Ginger Lemonade [I think that is the name]) and relaxed while looking at the Christmas decorations. The only bad part about the building our room was in is that there was no elevator in that building (some buildings have them and some don't). Overall I was very happy with our stay and highly recommend both Riverside and French Quarter.",

The private terrace is a great, usually quiet place to enjoy your goodies from La Boquería. Our balcony room was nice, but the balcony wasn't large enough to sit out on (though we could see chairs on the larger balconies for other rooms). Triple shutters helped to keep most of the street noise out. On the downside, the Wi-Fi was very flaky, especially in the room, less so on the terrace. The bathroom had a bit of a mildewy odor and the staff, though polite and professional, wasn't as warm and helpful as you might hope. Also, as others have observed, there are no in-room fridges or mini-bars. Overall, a nice place to stay, but if you're looking for more personal service or more amenities, you may want to look elsewhere.",

I thought this was a decent hotel, but I don’t think it lives up to all the raving reviews. The location of the hotel was quite perfect. It is just north of the most touristy area of Barcelona, which makes it very convenient but also not as chaotic/messy as the area south of it. It is also a block away from a metro interchange station (with multiple lines) and three blocks form a Rodalies station on the R2 line (i.e. frequent and direct trains to airport and Sitges, two of our destinations). One of our key criteria was to be close to the gay bars/clubs (so we can drag our tired a**es home in the middle of the night/early in the morning without too much hassle) and this hotel was perfect for that. Being close to the gay area also means that there are tons of nice/trendy restaurants nearby that less touristy. The front desk staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Though since it is a small boutique hotel it usually only has one staff member at the front desk. This means if there is a chatty client (or someone who did not do their travel research) in front of you, you might be waiting for a long while. The housekeeping staff can be a bit more attentive (the bathroom counter was dusty when we got there; we ran out of shower gel and were not given more for two days), but nothing too major to complain about. We stayed in standard double rooms. There were two legs to our trip so we stayed in two different rooms that were very similar. While I appreciate that the hotel boosts that “less is luxe”, the rooms are too minimalistic in my view (and I am someone who usually appreciate chic and simple). There are certain basic functional features that are missing, such as a desk, a chair, an alarm clock, a small fridge, a closet, an ice bucket, etc. The rooms were trendy and well decorated, but they were really small (even without the aforementioned furniture).",

On the couple of occasions we wanted to go a little further afield the hotel staff were very knowledgeable about the best way to get there using the excellent metro and bus systems. The reception at the hotel is staffed by young people with excellent English who are unfailingly helpful and friendly - great ambassadors for this beautiful city.

The spa was nothing more than 4 rooms with no amenities, no ladies or gents locker facilities, nothing but a few showers and a dangerous large bath tub, the service at the spa over the telephone was ridiculous, I felt like I was bothering them asking simple questions. Because I am an avid spa-goer I decided to visit the spa to have a face to face conversation as their prices are very high for a simple treatment. I got the same attitude just in person. Both the gentleman and lady were abrupt and discourteous, I did not book any spa treatments thank goodness, that spa was nothing more than a few rooms thrown together, total joke for a \"Trump inspired spa\". I dined in their restaurant and after finishing my mediocre and over priced meal overheard the waiter complaining of the amount of tip I had left to his colleagues! I checked out the next morning and moved to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel where first class service is always given, This is a joke of a hotel, the amenities are a bore, the gym is again facing buildings and with no life, the entire property is a cold experience, it actually gave me the creeps. The service from start to end was horrific, there was so much pretension, no ALOHA as they used that word every step I took. As a world traveler and an avid hotelier I would not recommend this property to anyone and will never step foot there again, take your vacation to a true destination not some want-to-be hotel where everyone that worked there was miserable, fake, quick to take your money, NO ALOHA, Trump International Hotel is Waikiki is a major thumbs down, if you want a real escape The Royal Hawaiian Hotel is where its at!",

You just cross the street from the hotel and the beach is like 50 ft. away through some green space. I was on the beach everyday and the proximity was a big surprise because looking on a map, it seemed a lot further. Also nearby are the shops and malls, and also plenty of restaurants to choose from. For a first time visit to Hawaii, it did not take much effort to find what I needed. I tried the spa and found it pricey for the experience that I got. I was there during the marathon weekend and the staff made the effort to make sure all guests were aware of the traffic issues and to help you get to the airport through the traffic mess.

Once you arrive you should ask for a cable but you will only be able to use the internet at the desk. When it works its good, when it doesnt, it doesnt and i usually abandoned my computer for few hours. There is wifi in the lobby. I had some issues with cleaning. Sometimes i would be left with 4 towels, sometimes just two, sometimes there would be no bin bags in the bin. the electricity card would be taken out and laptop would go out of charge. Small things. The self service washing machine costs 6eur, you get a tablet/powder for it. Dryer is 3 Eur. It works on time so this buys you two hour use of each.The bed is big and comfy but the pillows are square and not great.

It is very well positioned just one block back from the K'Damm, the iconic shopping and entertainment street of Berlin, and only 10 minutes walk from the lively Savignyplatz restaurant and shopping area, and the Savignyplatz train staion giving easy access to the rest of Berlin. My room had a small well-equipped kitchenette, which, with two supermarkets a block away, made preparing odd meals very easy. However there are plenty of restaurants nearby if you don't want to cook. The front desk staff were extremely helpful with little problems such as the cable TV not receiving English channels - quickly fixed. Free Wi-fi in the ground floor area actually made for quite a convivial atmosphere as people brought their computers and iPhones down to the lounge area.",

The buses to and from the airport also run along the Ku'Damm, even in the middle of the night if you have an early flight. Hotel room was spotless and had stylish decor with lots of storage and a comfy bed. I particularly liked having a safe within the room. This hotel is an \"Apart Hotel\" so rooms have a kitchenette. This was very useful meaning you could make your own breakfast and snacks if you liked. Our slight issue was that workmen are currently renovating a building next door and made noise quite early in the morning but on the positive it gets you up to make the most of your stay so it didn't spoil things! Besides, there is an incredible amount of building work going on in Berlin anyway so I expect many hotels have a crane next door to them so I'm not going to mark the hotel down for that as it's beyond their control. I would definitely stay here again.",

The room albeit small (standard room) was spotless we did look at the suites whilst in the hotel and they were just to die for!!! Huge and the furnishings wonderful well worth paying the extra, however saying that our standard room was excellent value for money. The breakfast exemplary cereals, croissants, crepe's to your taste, scrambled eggs bacon & sausage, all types of cake, yoghurts, bread rolls and bread for toast a selection of cold meats and cheeses, what a selection.

        "content": "We stayed for 3 nights. Prior to arriving I had applied for several types of standby upgrades, including the Business Plan upgrade. I discovered on arrival that I got the Business Plan upgrade. I received a letter from the front desk clerk informing me of what this included (internet, local and long distance phone calls, one breakfast daily, a bottle of water, etc). Boy was I glad I saved that letter. The staff at this hotel simply don't know what they offer. One of the days we went to breakfast. I had to argue with the hostess that I was 100% positive that one breakfast was indeed included on my room rate. And upon checkout I was told that long distance calls were not covered. I pulled out the letter to show the desk clerk that indeed they were covered. She quickly changed it and said that they had just changed what the business plan offered. Fair enough but then management needs to be better about communicating to staff about what is included in the rates. I don't want to have to go to the front desk to check out and get a corrected bill. I would rather have checked out online in my room. But this wasn't an option as the included charges had to be removed from the bill after the fact. Very annoying. Another annoying thing were the bellboys trying to hijack our luggage constantly. One bellman came over to my husband and TOOK his suitcase despite his protestations that he could manage it himself. It seems like they are simply desperate for tips. Or that's how it comes across to me. The location is good. The rooms were ok. But I wouldn't rate it high for cleanliness - I noticed an M&M on the carpet and it was still there the next day. Same for the gum wrapper that was near the chair. Bed slept ok though. All in all, I wouldn't say that it was a particularly good value for the money. And the management needs to get the staff to be more competent and knowledgeable.",

I took one out of the pillow case and found it was hard because it was jammed into this very skinny case that was about 12 inches wide. I guess they were going for looks, not function!

        "content": "Just returned from a short jaunt to Boston. We had two rooms located on the 10th floor. The set up of the hotel is odd, but nice. The valet parking ($43) is ridiculous and much more than other hotels located only blocks away. Rooms were nice but very tired looking, exception given to the beds which were extremely comfortable. The furniture and the bathroom are showing their age. Most noticeable was the carpet. This is not, of course,. something to ruin a stay, but noticeable in what's known as a 4 star hotel. Views were great as was the location of the hotel; walking distance to most spots or a quick jaunt on the T. Pool was okay. Small, but fine for a city hotel. Definitely about half the size of the photos. Service was okay. I jokingly asked the woman in \"gift shop\" what the markup on the gatorade was (@ $4/bottle) and she was extemely vicious in her reply. I truly was just kidding but she apparently didn't think it was funny. We were given connecting king rooms which obviously doesn't work with 2 adults and four children. This took quite some time to get resolved and the front desk person was not too helpful. The concierge was always helpful and gave us pretty good recommendations. The biggest plus is the location. Comparing the hotel to other Hyatt properties, the Boston prpoerty doesn't come close. They really do need to refresh the rooms.",

The Doorman was extremely friendly and wanted to help us right away. The front desk checked us in very quickly and we went up to the 19th floor to our room. Our room was comfortable and cozy. We had a wonderful view of the city of Boston. The king bed was outstanding and probably the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in. The decor of the room looked new and modern. There was a small chair in the room that I used a lot to read my Boston maps in. It was very comfortable for the size of that chair. We used the concierge several times while we were in Boston to find restaurants and trolley stops and tours. The concierge told us about a restaurant called \"Kennedys.\" We ate at the restaurant and we loved the food and the service was great! My husband used the workout room about 4 times while we were there and he said it was the best one that he had seen in any hotel. One thing that we found convenient while we were at the Hyatt was that you could enter Macy's store and walk through it to get to our hotel. It was 26 degrees outside and we were thrilled to be able to stay inside instead of braving the cold wind. My husband had left his gloves at home so he bought a pair at that Macy's. All of the people working at the Hyatt went out of their way to be helpful and friendly! Our floor was very quiet and we never heard any noises outside our door in the hallway. This hotel was a real joy to stay in and I would love to stay there again on our next visit. One last thing, we loved the fact that Christmas carols were playing all of the time by the elevators which put us in a festive mood. Thank you for that!!",

Very convenient to the T (trains) at Downtown Crossing and Park Street. It's a little bit dated in the elevators and public spaces, but the rooms are very nice, recently updated. One annoyance is that there is no outside entrance into the lobby of the hotel. From the street level, you have to take one set of elevators to the lobby, then cross the lobby and take another set of elevators to the room. The elevators are slow, so this can be annoying if you just want to get back to the room quickly. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even gave us early check-in on Friday at noon, and a late checkout on Sunday (2pm) which is much later than most hotels allow. The bed was great...one of the more comfortable I've slept in. My only complaint is that housekeeping didn't refill the coffee supplies for us, which isn't much to complain about. Also...a parking tip. Parking at the hotel is very expensive.

Front desk staff was courteous, check in was easy. Our room was small but looked as though it had been recently upgraded, and was attractively furnished. King bed was incredibly comfortable. Anthony, the concierge, was helpful and friendly. There are certainly more luxurious accomodations in Boston, but probably none more attractively priced in such a central location. I'd definitely stay there again.",

We stayed one night during the wine festival, and though it wasn't close to the Trade Center, it was only a short taxi ride away. The Hyatt looks like it may be an older hotel from the outside, but the rooms are totally updated with a modern touch to them. There was a nice atrium when we arrived on our floor, which gave the hotel a comfortable feel to it. The staff was friendly, and the location is wonderful (just a block from Boston Common area). The room is a fair size, with a very comfortable bed and very clean. The bathroom is average size, but very well appointed to. One downfall was the lack of a hotel safe. I haven't been to a \"4\" star hotel lately that did not include a safe. But other than that, we had an excellent stay at this hotel, especially because of the price we booked it at.",

Our room, which we upgraded to Ambassador level, put us oceanfront which had a magnificent view & included a sofabed & large club chair. The bathroom was a little small, but the extra vanity by the closet was helpful. The staff at the pool & beach area were very helpful. For travelers with children there are nearby chain restaurants: Chili's, Burger King, Ponderosa. A large grocery store 3 blocks was great to buy snacks & bottled water, cheese & crackers, yogurt, which we could keep in the fridge in our room. The taxi service in Puerto Rico is quick & clean. There is a public transportation stop just outside the hotel for sight-seeing such as Old SanJuan for $.75, but allow about 40 minutes each way. The best part of the trip was the ocean & pool areas & having our 4 p.m. pina coladas under our umbrella ($10. daily rental). Go & enjoy this great spot.",

        "content": "Booked 4 nights at the IC Hotel in January using priority club points. The stay was the absolute WORST IC hotel experience ever. I am a Royal Ambassador and was treated terrible by hotel management from check in to checkout. Hotel staff, especially Guest Relations and Front Desk Manager, was extremely rude when I questioned them on upgrading to a better (Platinum Royal Ambassador. Was told 3 different stories why I could not get upgraded to the Club floor or junior suite (standard practices at all other IC Hotels for Platinum Royal Ambassador Members). In addition to my experience with hotel management, the common hallways were very dirty and stayed that way for 2 of the 4 days. Rooms are very small and noisy. Would not recommend this hotel at all. I did not use hotel restaurants or bars in protest of check in experience. I do however recommend the restaurant and lounges at the El San Juan Hotel next door to IC which are extremely nice. Did use the IC spa and was cheated out of 15 minutes of paid spa time. When I complained to Spa manager her English went away. Relayed story to Front Desk Manager, who said he would look into the problem but never did. The last 2 years I have stayed on average 90 nights at priority club properties all over the world. This stay alone has encouraged me to seek out a new hotel group that treats all guest staying at their property (paid and reward nights) the same. If I am treated this way as a platinum royal ambassador, I canâ€™t image how other guest would be treated. Hotel appears to be more interested in entertaining the local population with their small casino than hotel guests.",

        "content": "My partner & I stayed here for 5 nights in early February after spending 3 nights at El Convento in Old San Juan (see separate review for that). Although I had done my research and expected the Intercontinental to be nice, the hotel really blew us away and exceeded our expectations in almost every way. First off, we got a great deal that included a free night and full breakfast every day. The breakfast buffet costs $25 per person so this was a great thing to have included. On top of that, we were upgraded for free to on ocean view room on the 7th floor when we checked in (we had booked and payed for a pool/garden view). Service was outstanding everywhere, from the door men to the car rental desk. The property is gorgeous and they are on a very nice, but busy, piece of beach. Like all of San Juan, drinks & food are expensive here. Although we didnâ€™t eat dinner at the hotel, we did have cocktails and lunches quite often at the beach bar restaurant. The hotel even has a wine bar which was very nice as well. As several other reviewers have mentioned, Isla Verde is not the place to stay if youâ€™re looking to visit OSJ which is why we split our 8 night trip between 2 different places. We rented a car one day and drove to El Yunque and a visit to Luquillo Beach. Although there was a lot of traffic, it was nice to be on our own schedule and it was also less expensive than going on an organized tour. Make sure to visit Nestor, the concierge, who was so helpful arranging or recommending anything. We did the spa one day and the facilities were very nice. There are several great restaurants close by; we actually ate better here than we did in OSJ which, again, surprised me. The best dinner we had our entire trip was at Pamelaâ€™s in Ocean Park, about a 15 minute drive from the hotel. Cheâ€™s, an Argentinean steak house, was also awesome and about a 5-10 drive or cab ride from the hotel. Within walking distance is Metropol for really great Cuban food. For the most part, we enjoyed the sun & sand here and basically relaxed in style which is exactly what we wanted. Highly recommended.",

The safe was locked when I got in the room and may have been broken, but I did not care and nothing was stolen. The pool is not heated, but it was over eighty and the water felt good after laying in the sun. There is seaweed in the ocean and last I checked that happens in the ocean. If you wade out about ten feet it was clear. The rooms are not huge but they are not small ala a w hotel. The staff was great, very friendly and helpful. The breakfast staff was exceptional at the buffet. Food at the pool and hotel was reasonable for a resort. Not cheap but not bahama expensive either. They do charge the resort fee as they indicated on the site when booking so no surprise there. Overall great hotel resort, easily walkover to el San Juan to see the crowds. As for improvements. New beach chairs would be nice as would fresh paint on the balconies and better reception on the television. Still all told my kids wanted to plan on going back next year.",

The room was nicely sized, and although our 7th floor ocean front faced a tree, we could see ocean to the right and left of the tree. It also looked over some ugly rooftops of buildings, and the balcony had only room to stand. Other than that, the hotel was just great. The pool was wonderfully large, with one bar in the pool and one on the ocean. The restaurants inside the hotel were rather expensive, but there are plenty of choices around the hotel. Take a couple of trips into Old San Juan, one in the day and one at night. At first we didn't think we would enjoy another trip to San Juan, but after a week, those thoughts were quickly banished.",

I had the pleasure to stay in a Executive suite with an amazing view of the Chicago Theatre and Macys and from the other side Millennium Park. The room was large for a boutique hotel with a separate living area. Bed was extremely comfortable. Everything from the Atwood Cafe, to the elevators to the opulent hotel lobby features the charm that Chicago is all about. Another huge bonus is the location of the Burnham. You are literally a stones throw from the Lake subway on the red line, another block to the blue line. You can get to either O'hare or Midway airport with ease using public transit if you wish. With the location and decor aside, the main part of this hotel that sets it apart is the service. Whatever we needed at the Hotel Burnham, we got. The front desk was sincere and helpful. The housekeeping staff left personal notes and did an excellent job cleaning up our suite. Everything from check in to check out had a personal touch that you just can't get at a Radisson or major hotel chain. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed the nightly wine receptions. This hotel exceeds any experience I've had at a city hotel, you won't be disappointed.",

We had a room overlooking the street but we were high enough not to be kept awake by the road noise. The staff were excellent - friendly and helpful but all very efficient. We did not eat in the restaurant but it did look nice but we had no food included in our room price.

We checked out bags in a holding room til the afternoon. We eventually made it back to the hotel around 3:00. The check in was lightning quick. We stayed in the historic section on 12 th floor in room 1205. We had great view of State and Washington and everywhere else. We had a deluxe queen comfortable bed , nice couch, desk, closet, mini bar, and flat screen. The showers had the best water pressure that I can ever remember. Aveda bath products if you're imto that sort of thing. I'm used to Hampton inn generic myself. The Burnham had a restaurant near the lobby that I wish we would have visited instead of Quartino Italian up the road. The folks working the front desk were friendly and very helpful. The location was good, right next to the blue and red line stations. If i return to Chicago, I will most certainly reserve a room here again. I recommend the Hotel Burnham, an Incubus concert at Northerly pavillion, and Bobby's bike tours.",

        "content": "My family of four spent my birthday in The Burnham in mid june. It was great. Martin, the front desk manager is a charming man who was kind enough to get my wife and me a corner room which allowed us to look up Washington to see the top of the Gehry pavilion in Millenium Park and down the truly great street, State Street, to see the Chicago theatre. We were directly kitty corner across the street from what was the flagship Marshall Field's store, sadly, now Macy's. It was a short 2 block walk to visit Millenium park and an easy walk a few more blocks to the Art Institute. Or, we could have turned left and walked the magnificent mile. The room was lovely and met all of our needs. We had breakfast in the bustling ground floor restaurant and it too was excellent. They also set out coffee for those who just want to grab a free cup of joe on your way out the door. Kimpton properties are uniformly well run and exude a \"fun\" vibe. This may be their very best property. The physical plant and the staff are excellent. My kids room was small, only 175 square feet but they use every inch and it did not feel crowded. I highly recommend this hotel.",

        "content": "I have never had to write a bad review based on service for any establishment, so this review should really come across as strong regarding service at the Burnham Hotel in Chicago. My issue revolves around making reservations for international guests and I was to book 6 rooms for two days (being a good customer). I never received any confirmations as promised and after the second day, I called and was transferred 4 times, cut off, and received a recorded prompt to leave a voice message. In a professional and courteous manner, I did just that. Four hours later, no call back from the hotel. I then called back on three occasions and it seems like everyone is a manager when you ask for one. Another important aspect of this is was the fact that I was booking direct through the hotel and not via a third party which can cause conflicts. I am shocked frankly. A four star hotel messes up reservations placed on a credit card twice. Then to top everything, when I went to book the rooms, the special group rate of $118.50 per room jumps to $190 and the arrogant representative on the line states, that is the best I can do. Luckily, I went to another hotel a block away, received rates for $90 for a better upscale hotel, and received an email confirmation within minutes. I am not sure why this happened and who is inept at the Burnham Chicago (A Kimpton Hotel), but never again will I stay at this chain. Brian",

        "content": "My 2 teenage daughters and I wanted a short weekend away and i was lucky enough to take advantage of a TravelZoo promotion at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago. From the welcoming e-mail we received a couple of days ahead of arrival right to the loading of the car at departure we were treated like royalty. The luxurious rooms,the restored wood and iron grills on the elevator were even appreciated by my daughters which from teenagers is a real compliment. The offer of a glass of wine when I first entered the lobby after stressing through rush hour traffic was very welcome. I know there have been lots of complaints about noise but we had a corner room on the 12th floor and we had no problems with noise. Even though we were across from the elevator we never heard anyone in the hallway-it was as if we had the place to ourselves. We had an amazing deal for the 2 nights but I'm already making plans to go back with my husband this time and I would happily pay the going rate if there are no discounts available. The hotel is central to everything and we enjoyed walking in all directions to see what was around the corners. My first trip to Chicago but I'll be going back for sure.",

First of all, the ambience is quite nice, where the up-to-date interior design exploits the charm of the historic architecture with quite a modern flare. My wife and I stayed in the smallest room available (queen bed), overlooking State Street, but found the space large enough for my needs. The room was very clean, comfortable, and visually pleasing. The view of the Christmas Tree and Macy's made it all the more romantic and quaint. The staff was quite professional and friendly. Overall, it was top-notch service and a great experience. I am now addicted to Kimpton hotels and will stay there as often as possible in my travels. Now most reviews are not found credible without some constructive criticism. While I have very little serious criticism of the hotel, I found the food selections, and in particular, the wine, at their restaurant slightly overpriced considering the competition of world-class dining in the area. However, the food and service was still, by-and-large, above average. Considering many respected hotels have much worse food quality but at inflated prices, this hotel's dining is definitely ahead of the game. Overall, a more more memorable hotel stay. Hotel Burnham is luxury at a very reasonable price.",

When I managed to fall asleep, at 1:30 am, I was woken by the noise again. It went on all night. Since we were staying the weekend - management moved us to another Kimpton hotel, but what a hassle.

        "content": "We spent a night here while in the area visiting family over Christmas, and had our dog with us. The Kimpton group, which owns this hotel, was always pet friendly when we had stayed at their other properties, and were just as much so here. Our dog is a 55 lb Shepherd mix, not a little lap dog, and that didn't phase them either. If you aren't into travelling with your pets, however, this place is still a gem. And as an aside, I didn't see anyone else there with their pets during our stay, so I would doubt the place is overrun with them for people who don't like animals. They also had us on a pet-friendly floor - so presumably you could also make sure you were on a floor without animals if you had allergies or something. The pet friendly rooms did not smell wierd or have anything wrong with them, they seemed just like all their other rooms - just, presumably, away from people who didn't want to be by animals! The location is fantastic - you could walk to all the great downtown spots from here, and you are smack in the middle of the theatre district. The rooms are small - but have very high ceilings and practically floor to ceiling windows, so they feel much larger than they are. Nicely decorated, that is the Kimpton hotel \"thing\" - all their properties are funky, boutique, edgy but always comfortable. Great bed at the Burnham, which I have luckily also had when staying at other properties of theirs. We didn't eat at the restaurant because we had other plans for our meals while there, but it was always full of people and the menu looked appealing. Staff was very friendly, even when our dog woofed at those wearing hats (she's a Shepherd mix, what else can I say?) and helpful (with directions and similar). We paid $152 + tax and valet parking - and again I think this is one of the best values for the money in downtown Chicago. We have stayed at a number of downtown hotels over the years - and (with or without our dog), this is definitely a hotel we would come back to next time.",

Located in the heart of Chicago's Loop, right across the street from Marshall Field's flagship store (soon to be Macy's), one block from the theater district and two blocks to Millennium Park. Service was unbelievable. The room was immaculate (but on the small size) and was decorated in a late '90's plush whimsical style. There is a Sony CD player in the room along with an honor bar (not those obnoxious electronic mini-bars in big hotels that charge you just for looking). The rooms also feature tall ceilings and huge windows with great views of the city. Also supplied with the rooms are a terrific selection of bath amenities, two plush bath robes and the thing that impressed me the most...a dimmer switch for the bathroom lights. Genius! Complimentary wine is served in the lobby in the evening and Starbucks coffee and teas are set up in the mornings. I didnâ€™t get a chance to check out the hotel restaurant, but I have heard that the food is outstanding. This is a boutique hotel that is a wonderful alternative to the huge convention hotels that populate the Loop and Michigan Avenue areas. I would highly recommend the Hotel Burnham.",

        "content": "What is most impressive about this hotel is its quality in virtually all areas for a restored, historic building in the heart of downtown. Note - if you want to be very handy to the Mag Mile (N. Michigan Ave) or the Convention Center, this is not the place. But it's good to see a vibrant downtown all around you, with transportation readily available. For transportation, the subway (Red line) is across the street, the El is a block or two away, and taxis and buses can handle the rest. Leave your car (parking is expensive, but this is downtown, and any major cities have comparable high prices downtown), unless you need to drive a distance - parking in the city in any desired destination is usually difficult. Yes - it's pricey, but it offers excellent furnishings and very good service. The concierge desk was helpful. The only glitch in service was maid service one day, when some things in the room were missed. It was reported, and didn't happen again. Lobby staff (front desk, doormen, bellmen) were excellent. The in-house restaurant (Atwood Cafe) receives very good reviews. Room service is from there. We ate there one lunch - it was good, but crowded (tables too close), service only fair, and not worth the money. There are very good restaurants in the Loop, even in walking distance. (Trattoria #10 around the corner, the Berghoff, the Russian Tea Time, for example) Other restaurants (we like Greek restaurants in Greektown and mideastern on the north side) are a taxi ride away. A tip - the Corner Bakery is a chain all over town - ask for directions to the nearest one(s). They have good pastries, sandwiches, at reasonable prices. A bottled juice from the Walgreens next door, a pastry, and coffee made in the room was a fine breakfast. Contrary to what was on the Kimpton website, this is not on the Mag Mile (that's a mile away), and Millenium Park is not across the street (it's 2 blocks to the east). There's some interesting shopping on State Street (not as glitzy and huge as Mag Mile). The views from the room (we had a corner, with views up State Street, and over to the lake) are fantastic. If you like being in the heart of a bustling city, this is a good choice. It's small enough to feel personalized, and always felt safe. (Admittedly, we were not out real late at night.) We were there as tourists (had lived near Chicago many years ago). The Culture Center (with a good bookstore and noon concerts) is a block away. Took an easy busride to Museum Campus (Field Museum - the best). Recommended - the boat tour on the river, guided by the Chicago Architecture Foundation.",

Not cheap but centrally located on the edge of the Loop. If you want shopping fall out of bed and you are in Marshall Fields , a little walk and you are on Michigan Avenue or on the river doing a sightseeing trip. Big tip- the blue line CTA from O Hare airport stops yards from the hotel, great if you have loads of luggage but only want to spend $1.75 on transport! I read that the rooms were cramped. I wasnt in a suite yet the space was fine and the view unbelievable. When we were there we had a prime view of the Memorial Day parade down State Street from our room. The room surroundings and fittings were reminiscent of a golden area, based on Art Deco. The toiletries are Aveda and, its true, there is a turndown service with chocolates left on the bed on your return (except on the last night!!). And.......you also get free Starbucks from 6-9am in the lobby so you can take a cup back to your room. When I went down the night shift concierge was very friendly and helpful. There is also a free wine reception in the evening. The Attwood Cafe is rated but we didnt try it. Instead we tried deep dish pizzas at Guardinos chain (you will have a job to finish one!), Pot Belly sandwiches and had breakfast in Johnny Rockets, just like a 50's diner. So... its not too small, great views from the room, great location, free Starbucks and turndown service. It doesnt get much better. Only gripe generally was that there is a free trolley service to most central places but it wasn't advertised anywhere in the city that I could see. Most stop near the hotel.",

We paid extra to get a good view and it was worth it. (I think some rooms face a brick wall across an alley.) It was nice to sit in the window seat and watch the city.

There is so much to do and see within walking distance or you can hop a bus or the el to get you anywhere else in the city. Cabs are also plentiful here. The doorman is happy to get you one if you need it. The lobby is beautiful, the people at the front desk are always welcoming and a complimentary cocktail hour is included (every night, if I'm not mistaken.) The rooms are AWESOME! HM is a boutique and is classically Kimpton in that the rooms are decorated with a modern and unique flair. We stayed in a room with a huge window nook that overlooks the river. Super cool. It's notable that although HM is in a prime location, I have never heard any street noise. This is hard to find in the city-I'd even be willing the pay a little more for the quiet, but you don't have to here! The best part about this place is the value. We paid around $130 on a nice Chicago weekend. I suspect prices go higher on prime Chicago weekends in summer (airshow, Taste of Chicago, etc.) but they do everywhere, so book a stay here and try it out. You'll be glad you did!",

This hotel is in the heart of everything, in my opinion. Each day I got out and walked around made me realize what a fantastic location this place is. I got lucky and got a fantastic high room with a view of the river. Part of what makes this hotel unique is that each room has a nook, which juts out over the street so you have (or I had) a fantiastic view of the street and the river. It's a great place to read and watch over the city. We used it ever day we were there. The hotel had a very lively social hour each day, that many people went down to hang out. Of the 5 nights I was there, I could walk to 4 of the restaurants I booked. Walking to the Michigan shopping district took less than 10 minutes. I love the comforter on the bed. The staff was great and you can \"adopt\" a fish if you get lonely, believe it or not.",

Check in was a breeze, the bellman brought up our bags and gave us a tour of the room and everything in it and made sure we were good before he left. I think everyone talks about the window seats, but I'm going to talk about them too because it was the BEST thing about the room. It was the first place I went to when we would come back to the room, they are great. The bathroom was super nice. The bathtub was huge, the shower was a bit on the small side, but it worked fine. The separate living room with a tv was nice and the room was decorated beautifully. The bed was very comfortable and the staff brought up extra pillows within 5 minutes of calling the front desk for them. The staff was great about answering questions about good restaurants and some great local festivals that were happening over the weekend. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a clear view of the river which was beautiful, especially at night. I posted a comment on the hotels facebook page and when we came back one evening there were two cupcakes waiting for us, with a nice note thanking us for being a facebook fan...it's the little things! :) Kimpton Hotels really know what they are doing. They truly know how to make people feel comfortable and know how to make people happy. The coffee/tea in the mornings was great and the wine reception in the evening was a great way to meet other travelers and get to know people. I can't wait to go away again just so I can stay at a Kimpton Hotel, the next time I think I'll bring my dog.",

The living area was large with plenty of seating and a desk. The desk being in the living area was great because my teenage son likes to stay up late on the computer. The sofa bed could use replacing, but isn't that always the case with sofa beds. The bedroom was huge and being a corner room with window seating you could sleep on, provided great views overlooking the river. Two flat screen TV's were also a plus. We always enjoy the afternoon wine in the lobby free of charge! Since it was extremely cold this time of year, the morning coffee and tea and afternoon hot chocolate hit the spot. Hotel Monaco is located in a great location for visiting the Theatre District, Art Museum, Macy's, the park, etc., but the only downside are the beggars that hang out on the corner outside the hotel. One night we were screamed and cursed at as we walked to dinner, and another time we were stopped by someone as we walked back from Mag Mile. During the day the area is crowded with shoppers and workers and there are no problems, but later in the evening it's more secluded. We've been in the summer when the days are longer and have had no problems.",

Free internet for Kimpton members--so it is worth joining. Good location for walking north up the Magnificent Mile, close to many excellent restaurants, and around the corner from the theatre district. Excellent nearby public transportation. We especially appreciated the hotel staff. All were professional, helpful and attentive. The 5-6 p.m. wine hour was well managed and also offered a small tray of hors d'oeuvres. The atmosphere is subdued elegance with a small entry reception area, and beautiful well designed guest rooms in an art deco style. Considering how close it is to the trams, which is a plus if you like to use public transportation, we were not disturbed by the noise.You need to ask if you wish a coffee pot in the room. Hot beverages are available in the lobby in the morning. Cold beverages were available throughout the afternoon. Would definitely go back to the Hotel Monaco Chicago.",

If only they had a location in New Orleans or San Antonio! A few things to know before your stay..using the business room was a bit overpriced, so if you have to print anything off during your trip try to do it before you get there. Also, if you want your room cleaned when you leave for the day just $@!#% around the sign on the door so it says Service. The maid service was outstanding so I recommend it! We left to see the sights around 12PM each day and they still came to our room each day, Another couple travelling with us did not get their room cleaned because they did not use the door sign, One of the friends I travelled with works for a very popular hotel chain and agrees that this place rocks! Room 410 has no cushion in the window seats but we were so impressed with the rest of the room, I'd still recommend it...the view and overall experience was worth MORE than what we paid. :)",

        "content": "We stayed at the Monaco for an all-too rare weekend of shopping and relaxing. So when I first walked in, I was a bit disappointed. The Hotel Monaco has the small rooms of an older hotel and I had hoped to stretch out in a bit more luxury. BUT, the staff and their courteous and prompt attention to detail, and the hotel's location quickly turned me around. Yes, our room was small, but it was clean, the bedding was elegant and comfortable, the shampoo and beauty products were wonderful (after this, I'm going to find them on-line to purchase them), the robes were comfy, and the bar was well-stocked. The Hotel Monaco is in a great location -- steps from shopping, dining, and entertainment on Michigan Avenue and State Street (it's just south of the river). We walked less than a block to dinner at McCormick and Schmick's (we LOVED it); got the bus around the corner to go to the Museum of Science and Industry and a few other places when it was raining; found a few spots nearby for a relaxing drink; and generally found the location to be as convenient as any (we typically stay at the Intercontinental, which is right on Michigan Avenue, but wanted to try something different this stay). Then there's the staff: from the moment we walked in the door, everyone greeted us with a \"hello\" or \"good morning\" or \"good night\" and a smile. The concierge was helpful. The bellhop was helpful and friendly. The first time the woman behind the front desk left her spot as I walked in the lobby and beat me to the elevator to push the buttons for me (both outside the elevator and in), I was impressed; I soon came to expect that kind of simple, extra attentiveness and courtesy from every staff member there. My husband is a very big man (6'4\", 250) and so we typically like our rooms large so he doesn't feel cramped. The Hotel Monaco made up for the small rooms with its very big heart.",

The location is fine and rooms are quiet enough but we had a few complaints. The biggest problem is that the windows don't open - not even a crack. The recycled air was very dry and made the room a little stuffy. The cleaning service (as mentioned in previous reviews) was not great - bed turndown was inconsistent and parts of the room seemed untouched. There was peeling and scratched wallpaper and the caulking around the bathtub was a little moldy and stained. The reception staff was inconsistent as well. The concierge service wasn't the most professional. Having said all this, I need to say that the rate I recieved from Hotwire was very reasonable. I find it hard to call this hotel substandard because compared with other downtown \"four-star\" establishments in Chicago, it was no different. However, the higher rates one pays when conventions are in town would have left us disappointed. I don't see any reason to choose this Kimpton over, say, the Hotel Intercontinental.",

It was very convenient for my commute to the suburbs for work, but was right by all the theaters and shopping in downtown. And the AC was fantastic!",

        "content": "We stayed here for just one night with our 6 and 4 year old girls. Having lived in Chicago for 15 years, we wanted a hotel close to Michigan Ave and Near North for our kids, knowing they would love this area. The Omni's location really was perfect...Water Tower, Hancock, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, great food, museums, shopping, river, loop, etc. all located within walking distance. Upon checking in, the kids were given these cute little backpacks filled with activities and treats. They thought this was great and wore them for the next 2 days. At the check-in desk, I asked about a room with a view. There wasn't one ready (and I didn't pay for one) but the clerk said it would be about an hour if I wanted to wait. He took my cell phone number to call me when it was ready. So we stored our luggage and walked down to Navy Pier for a boatride. Sure enough, within about 55 min the hotel called to let me know we could check in. The room was quite spacious for a downtown, city hotel room. A small living area with a sofa and tv, desk and bar area made up the first part. Through a set of double doors was a bedroom, also a decent size, with two double beds. The bathroom was nice as well and the closet had a lot of room. Went down to the pool, which was a bit of a dissapointment. It is a little small, but being a city hotel I can understand that. The three main issues I had were: 1) the temperature of the pool area was freezing! Everyone in there (I'd say 12-15 adults/kids) were either in the pool, which was warmer than the air, or wrapped up in the pool towels for warmth. It was very uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all. 2) the hot tub wasn't on and wasn't filled. Considerng the temp of the air, this was even a bigger disappointment. At least 6 people came down to use the hot tub while we were there, only to be disappointed by its emptiness. 3) the pook deck itself is made of tile and is incredibly slippery when wet. Why in the world this kind of tile was chosen for the pool area is beyond me. Three people, including myself, almost wiped out. I was really worried the kids would fall and hit their heads. It really was poorly designed. When we got back from dinner, housekeeping had turned down our bed, replaced all of our towels (which we had used when we got back from the pool) and left milk and cookies. The kids were so thrilled with this little gesture. The last thing I'll report about is leaving something in our room. Unfortunately, after we checked out and were driving out of the city, we realized that our 4 year old's favorite stuffed animal had been left in the room. I called the hotel and was connected with Chris in security. He took my name and number and promised to call me back after looking for the stuffed animal. Within 10 minutes he had found the bunny, called me back and offered to FedEx it, on Omni's dime, to our home. It arrived today. I was very impressed with the Omni and will definitely return on our next visit. The service was excellent and their treatment of the young kids was really refreshing.",

Unfortunately, the neighboring building is expanding upward about 20 feet (maybe less) from your windows on the south side of the building. So, if view is not important to you, this remains a fantastic hotel. If seeing a concrete wall right out your window is disconcerting, either make sure you reserve a room type that faces Michigan Avenue or consider other options.",

There is a seperate sleeping area, but our room had no door, despite specifically requesting one. When we called to ask for a room change, another room was not available to us. Also, we asked for cribs and a refrigerator to be in the room and even called ahead of time to verify the requests we had through our online booking. Despite our efforts, the cribs and a refrigerator still were not in the room when we arrived. Housekeeping quickly did bring them to the room, but while we had planned ahead, the hotel had not.

They were very friendly and courteous. The room was very cozy and spacious. The bathroom was great as well. We had a nice view of Michigan Ave. as well which we loved. And the room was super clean. In some places you stay, you notice bed fabric torn or a stain on the ceiling, but our room was pristine. The only thing that was annoying was the pocket door leading into the bedroom from the bathroom. Every time we got up to use the washroom in the middle of the night, it makes a lot of noise. Also-the bedroom could use another lamp, such as a floor lamp for more lighting. But otherwise what a cozy room !!! And I have to add that the breakfast buffet is awesome! I will definitely be back to stay for sure. Great location and great price!!!",

We were treated like royalty. We stayed in one of the Governor's Suites. It was very spacious, very clean, and tastefully decorated. All rooms are suites with a TV in the living room, and one in the bedroom. The Omni is right on Michigan Avenue where you are just steps away from shopping and restaurants. As a Select Guest Member, my husband and I received a pot of coffee, juice and newspaper each morning, at the time chosen by us. If you choose to stay at the Omni, you might want to consider joining their Select Guest Program. It is free and there are so many amenities included. You get your choice of high floor/low floor, near the elevator/away from the elevator, and so much more.When I joined I received a 50% off coupon for a weekend stay. I also received another coupon for an upgrade. And, of course you receive the coffee, juice and newspaper delivered to your door in the morning at no charge.

There were two sets of elevators to get to our room but we never had to wait more than one minute for an elevator. It felt like extra security. Staff was attentive but not smothering. Only complaint I have is that the temperature was difficult to regulate. In order for the room to stay cool the way we like it, we had to leave the fan on. The auto setting did not seem to work, or at least I couldn't work it. It is a minor complaint and is way over-shadowed by all the wonderful things. Would definately stay here again.",

Our only glitch was the 30 minute delay in getting our room (they offered us a different room on the 5th floor, but there was too much chlorine smell from the pool). We went up a floor to the lounge to wait and Jennifer A. of the concierge staff tracked us down and gave us some food vouchers for our trouble. This is the type of quality service that I have always experienced at Omni's.",

He checked in the night before I arrived. He left my name at the desk and I had no problem obtaining a key. The room is very comfortable and having the two rooms makes it nice when one person is a nightowl or gets up early to go to work. TVs in both rooms. DVD player in the living area (and a Blockbuster is about a block away). Bed was super comfy with high quality linens. We had a corner room (1717) and looked north and west. Not a great view but good light. We did have the mini bar key and used that refrig to store small things in. (There's a Trader Joe's three blocks away.) The entire staff was pleasant, efficient and professional. The concierge gave us some great ideas for dining and made reservations for us. The location is great, just off Michigan Ave. across from the Apple Store. The red line train is 3 blocks away at State and Chicago. We got a good rate: $159 during the week and $171 over the weekend nights. Good value for the quality. Sign up for their loyalty program and get free wifi and delivered coffee and juice in the morning. But skip their restaurant. It's nothing special and there's lots in the area. Also the business center charged $6.95 per 15 minutes to use the internet (although you could print airline boarding passes for free). I just waited until BF got back with his laptop. Finally, sign up for a Chicago Greeter. I had a great 4 hour walkabout and saw things and explored neighborhoods I'd never been to before.",

It is also right on Michigan Ave where all the shopping is. Parking was very steep in price. A tip, we parked a couple blocks down the road in a public garage for about half the price. It was a little bit of a walk but we saved some money. Flat panel TV's, nicer restaurant, great place. If this is good enough for Oprah's people, it's good enough for most of us.

Sheets and towels were changed daily. The beds were comfy and there was no noise problems at night. I would advise anyone wishing to book this hotel to book via the hotel directly. I booked through a third party website and i would not do this again as the hotel room type I booked was not the one I recieved.

        "content": "The best part of my stay at the Omni (for a conference held at the hotel) was by far the hotel staff: the front desk clerks were cheerful and efficient, the concierge pleasant and helpful, and the housekeepers responsive to requests. On the other hand, the Omni is both the noisiest and dustiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It apparently is located directly on the hospital route...ambulances screamed by at all hours of the day and night. One night there was a weird drumming (I am was on the 11th floor) that lasted about 90 minutes; during the day there was lots of drilling noise, which presumably will go away once the reno is finished. The upside of the noise was that it provided unexpected entertainment--sitting on the toilet, with a vent directly above, it is possible to hear every single word of the conversations taking place in an adjacent room. An eavesdropper's delight! Aside from the noise, the hotel was dusty--everywhere. In my room; in the conference meetings room; the the bar; in the business center--in short, every facility I used at this hotel needed a thorough cleaning. When I checked into my room, I opened the curtain behind the bed, and to my disgust, it seemed as if every previous tenant of the room had left his or her hand, nose or lip print on the window. It was so gross I asked housekeeping to clean it up--which to their credit they did promptly. What others have said about the weird layout of the rooms was true for me, although it was not a major inconvenience or distraction. It did seem odd, though, that there was no light switch in the bathroom adjacent to the entry door from the bedroom side of the suite. The location of this hotel is superb, and it's fine for what it is--a fair-to-middlin' hotel. It is not four-star and it is not luxe, but it gets the job done.",

The bed was very comfortable, the pillows were ok. Still, we had a great night sleep. In the morning we ate at their restaurant, they had a breakfast buffet, but we ordered off the menu. Everything was delicious and the wait staff was excellent. We would definately stay at this hotel again. We used Express Checkout and left.

        "content": "The Omni is right in the heart of things and is very upscale. It is an all suite hotel and I had one of the basic ones (called a deluxe king suite I think). I got a good rate for the dates and star level through hotwire so I was a little concerned, but I needn't have been. It is absolutely clean. It is very roomy with deluxe bedding, upscale designed wood, marble and granite everywhere. Plasma TV in the sitting room and another TV in the bedroom, free wifi. It was very roomy. Great Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room. A CD player in the alarm clock. Electronic temp control. Wetbar. I enjoyed the view from the 20th floor. The artwork in the elevator and lobby were probably done in China in a factory to look like real artwork (yuck). I thought the desk people were decent, but I felt there was a general lack of warmth and helpfulness that was so evident in my stay at the Hotel Indigo the night previous. It made me feel less than welcome, so the \"shwank\" was wasted on me. I did like the conveniences. Valet parking is 40.00 a night so ask about self park, it is just around the corner under some shopping mall (I can't for the life of me remember what it was called) for 28.00 a night. It is valet too, just not from right in front of the hotel. Great location if you want to do the shops on Mag Mile. Short bus or cab rid to other downtown sights like the Art Institute or King Tut (Field Museum). I didn't have time to check out the resturants, but there have to be so many really good ones nearby, it's Michigan Ave. There are sirens and other loud street noises as you might expect dowtown, but I was able to sleep with earplugs. This would be a very nice place for a romantic weekend or a business trip.",

        "content": "My sister and I decided to get away for the weekend and meet in Chicago. She had heard great things about the Omni, so we decided to stay there in November 2005. The Omni Chicago is located right on Michigan avenue, which was great, because we could just walk ouside the hotel and immediately enjoy walking the Magnificent Mile. From the moment we pulled our rental car up the hotel, the bell staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. Surprisingly, they were the ones that demonstrated what customer service should be. When we got inside the hotel to check in, we experienced the complete opposite. We patiently waited for someone to acknowledge us. No one else was standing in front of us. This lady behind the desk looked up at us, didn't say a word then continued what she was doing. She could have said, \"I'll be right with you.\" We didn't mind waiting, but some sort of acknowledgement would have been nice. Finally, she looks up, puts out her hand (as if to motion us to come) and still doesn't say a word. I'm surprised she didn't whistle and pet us once we approached the desk. No \"Welcome\" or \"Hello\" or anything! She was downright rude and made us feel like we didn't deserve to be there. (We're in our 20's, are young professionals who were raised with excellent manners, and came dressed nicely--not in anything inappropriate). I guess because we didn't look rich or established to her, we didn't deserve any bit of service. After she checked us in, she gave us our room keys, and again, didn't say a word. She never pointed out where the elevators were, so we had to search for them. That was the only bad experience. The room we had was very nice, chic and modern with warm colors. The view is typical of a city view...lots of buildings. There was a large bedroom, a sitting area with a desk and a moderate sized bathroom. The beds were very comfy. I really liked all the rooms except for the bathroom...it was dim and didn't seem to fit with the room, because it wasn't that nice and looked like any other bathroom at a Holiday Inn. The restaurant is average. However, the room service is excellent and the food delicious...definitely as if we were dining in an upscale restaurant. The desserts were also very good. In summary, it's a great place to stay if you want to be close to all the shops and restaurants on Michigan Avenue. The bell desk staff should teach the front desk staff how to be professional and welcoming. They deserve the highest praise and made up for the rude front desk person.",

Very difficult to navigate the numbering system to the floors but as a compromise there are pictures of very famous entertainers all along the hallyways so you can remember \"turn right at Nat King Cole\".. or something similar. The room I was in had been upgraded at some point because it had granite in the bathroom and a newer bowl shaped sink. But the age of the hotel still shows through in the tiling in the bathroom. Also I had wallpaper peeling in my room and the part of the showerhead that attaches to the wall was hanging off. Not appreciated for this level of hotel and the rates it commands. I didn't have a view, just some part of the rooftop. Kept the curtains drawn. However I did not have a view of the train tracks, which I heard several complaints about. The tracks are very close to the hotel. This is not the hotel's fault but if you are on that side of the hotel it may disturb you. Seems they run more frequently during the day but it's something worth checking out. For sure if you are on that side of the hotel request a high floor so you are not literally next to the train. There is no shelf space in the bathroom if that is important to you. The sink takes up most of the counter and there is no additional shelving. There is a small glass shelf about the size of a couple of postcards on the wall but that was very loose and unstable in the room I was in. The bathroom door would not remain open so I propped it open with an ottoman and put a towel on top of that and used it for additional space to lay items. In room dining was fast and very nice; usual hotel pricing. About $22 for a full breakfast of meat, potatoes, eggs, juice, tea and toast, including tax and mandatory service charge. I found the service to always be top notch.",

        "content": "Spent three nights here on business. The room in the 20th floor was huge compared to typical European hotel rooms. Breakfast was not included in the price, so I took the Hilton buffet breakfast (USD 20) every morning. In this option you can also order omelette, pancakes, etc. separately, but all waiters did not remember to tell that. The buffet was very good. The swimming pool is too small and warm for serious swimming, but nice for just relaxing. I did not find any change room, so I had to change the swimsuit in the separate toilet/shower room. The location is great, and the hotel is very beautiful, especially the famous lobby. There was a large meeting at the hotel, and during the meeting the elevators were really slow: in some cases I had to wait 5-10 minutes to get one.",

I returned with my sister for the weekend and we were pleased overall. As some have commented, the wait for the elevators is a problem. We were lucky as we were upgraded to the executive level and so had use of an express elevator. A couple times though we took the regular ones and the wait was very, very long. The hotel was quite busy this weekend for Sox Fest which could explain the long waits. All staff we encountered - at the bar, restaurant, front desk and even housekeeping were so nice and friendly. Even the doormen were exceptionally nice. As others have stated, the rooms are a \"bit\" small but not tiny by any means. We had no noise issues this trip whatsoever and that might be because we were on the executive level. It's not the most convenient for shopping, but taxis are frequent, prevalent and inexpensive so really no issue at all. I thought the price was very reasonable at $130 per night for downtown Chicago. I recommend this hotel.",

        "content": "I was initially excited when I booked a room at The Palmer House on Priceline for a romantic getaway to Chicago, this this was very short lived. Upon arrival we were greeted by a Valet, who spoke very broken English. He asked if we needed assistance with our luggage to which we answered yes, he proceeded to give us our ticket and said we were all set. We then stepped in to a very impressive lobby (which is all that was impressive in this hotel) and waited in a long line to check in. The front desk clerk acknowledged that we booked through Priceline and assigned us a room, whcih was to have a been a room to accommodate 2 adults. We then entered a very TINY room that consisted of about 120 sq feet and a single bed. We promptly realized that this would not be acceptable accommodations for two people, as guaranteed by priceline, and returned to the front desk. At the desk we were informed that there are no guarantees when booking through Priceline, that we pay less than their other guests, therefore the rooms are assigned to the full paying guests and Priceline customers get the remaining rooms. After some argument we were able to be assigned another room. This room was slightly larger in size and included a \"Queen bed\" a little room to walk around it and a very small bathroom. There was construction outside of our room. The room had peeling wallpaper in multiple areas and was very dated with an old tube television and dated bathroom fixtures. It did not meet my expectation when I think of a \"4-Star\" hotel. The hotel did provide a 15x25 foot pool to accommodate it's over 1,000 rooms. It had a fee to use it's fitness room, a fee to use it's wired internet (as there was no Wi-Fi available)and we were not able to use the concierge due to an extensive line, therefore we chose to fend for ourselves rather than spend hours in line. Our luggage never did make it to our room, we had to contact valet and were escorted through the parking garage to retrieve our luggage ourselves. I would not recommend staying at this hotel to anyone and would not return to it. The time we spent outside of the room was very enjoyable and Rock Of Ages was great! I would recommend checking out Rock of Ages while in Chicago! :)",

While a bit more pricey than regular rooms, the executive level included a continental breakfast and a happy hour, both with substantial offerings of good , solid foods. In this regard, don't let the title \"continental breakfast\" fool you. It included hot and cold cereals, cold cuts, a broad assortment of rolls, coffee and teas. Alcoholic drinks were available during happy hour at a reasonable price (champagne cocktails for 6 dollars each). The rooms were LARGE, very clean and comfortable. Within walking distance of the Civic Opera House (which we attended both nights) and the Art Museum (be sure to check out the new addition to the museum) and north Michigan Avenue, the Palmer House is an ideal spot from which to launch your sightseeing of the windy city.",

Since I was in and out of the room in under 16 hours I didn't get to walk around much however, the train is close by and there were a lot of shops and a starbucks across that stayed open later than the one in the hotel. There is no coffee maker in the room but, the gentleman who delivered room service said we just needed to request one and they would bring it for us.

We usually stay at Kimpton properties while in Chicago - good rates, friendly staff, the wine hour. But we were going to Lollapalooza, which was only a couple of blocks up Monroe, and I got a decent rate on the Executive floor with self-park included. The hotel has been beautifully redone. The check-in was efficient and friendly. We got to our room - no mini bar. That drives me crazy, personally. Not that I ever use it, but we do like to stuff our leftovers in the fridge! I was not going to pay for a fridge to come to the room. Also - no free internet. I may be crazy, but as a silver HHonors member I believe I had free internet before. You can go to a Hampton and get it - why not the Palmer house? Ugh. The room was nice. Small, but nice. Bed was comfy, they usually are at Hilton properties. The bartender in the executive lounge had no clue on how to make a martini with a lemon twist - my husband ended up with a lime after she asked if he wanted olives. One evening we stopped at the lobby bar, Potter's, for drinks before going to bed, and the bartender had no idea what I was asking for - a wine that was on their somewhat limited by the glass list. I had to point it out. Also - for whatever reason they were not allowing carry out of food that evening. And they were a bit abrupt telling people about it. We had our drink and went upstairs where we had a bottle of wine waiting. When it was time to check out I called the bell desk to have them get our bags - we were going to do some shopping before leaving the city. I was asked (also abruptly) \"are you ready?\". NO. I always call the bell desk when I'm not ready. Then he went to the wrong room. He had to go back downstairs and find out where he was supposed to be going. When we came back for our bags I was told that I couldn't have them until my husband was in front of the hotel with the car. OK. So when he got there, there was a huge line. I finally got my turn, and the bellman who had my luggage moved so s-l-o-w-l-y that I almost grabbed the cart myself. Then he just stood there and let my husband load the car! Ugh. Anyway, it was an ok stay, we've had worse in better places. But we were disappointed in little things. Next time we will be back at a Kimpton property.",

The hotel is impressive because it is in a traditional building, but it lacks in the details. This hotel is very big and it is always busy so there is not much care for personal attention to customers. I had the unfortunate experience of ordering a cup of coffee at the lobby area bar. The waitress was very unfriendly, took forever for the coffee to arrive and it was cold. Fortunately, there is a Starbucks in the premisses.

One thing I really appreciated was the fact that there is parking available that is easily accessible from the hotel. Although expensive ($38/day), for me, it was worth it.The hotel looks magnificent!The staff was friendly and professional. Besides the bedroom being very spacious and clean, there was nothing special there. The bed was comfortable and they do need to upgrade their TVs .The bathroom was small and I think they could have done a better job by adding a soaking tub. I hated the fact that they charge for internet access.($15/hr if you're in your room; I think it's less if you're in the lobby) but I guess it's because of the clientele they get which I noticed was more of businessmen. So if you are like me, traveling across country and just need to check on some stuff for few minutes, there's a Starbucks right down the street with free wi-fi.",

        "content": "The Palmer House is a Chicago landmark. She's played hostess to presidents and the well off and beautiful. She's earned her place in the sun. Still, like many of her kind, the years haven't necessarily been kind. While glimpses of her former beauty and personality still shine through, her features have slackened and become somewhat unrecognizable through the years. Her main lobby, complete with dramatic staircases, more often resembles the chaotic terminal of an airport, than an elegant and serene foyer in which to relax with a pot of afternoon tea and pastries. In the three days I was in residence there, there was virtually no time - save very late in the evening - when this lovely area wasn't besieged with families of travelers and their resulting luggage. It seems as though the hotel might choose to find another location that their arriving and departing guests might lounge with suitcases, rather than the elegant, main lobby/tea room. The rooms, (at least our room was), in good repair, clean, and reasonably attractively furnished. The view wasn't outstanding, but I rarely blame an urban hotel for that. Everyone can't have the best view, and that is an acceptable point. The bathroom, while clean and adequately furnished, was very small. Subsequently, it was very crowded for my my own, as well as my husband's, toiletries to fit on the small shelf over the sink. The shower was fine. This was not a four or five star hotel in my opinion, but likewise, we didn't pay four or five star prices, either. The interior hallways leading to the bedrooms need a little attention. The wallpaper is peeling in places, and lends a dingy feel of neglected grandeur. Room service was delivered on more than one occasion, and the hotel was notably quick with their delivery - both times in less than half an hour. The restaurant, as well as the more casual bar, were both very pleasant experiences. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning. The buffet was more than adequate, but in addition to this - any person paying for the buffet had the opportunity to order off the menu as well at no additional charge. For example, if a person would prefer an omelette or Eggs Benedict rather than the scrambled eggs offered in the buffet line, this option was readily made possible for the guest. I travel frequently, and I'm not aware of any other hotels with this nice offer. Dinner in the same restaurant was fine also, but not inexpensive. We tried a pre-fix menu of three courses paired with three different beers. It was an interesting concept, but the dinner wasn't anything especially noteworthy. The location was convenient to most major attractions, and of course that is a huge boon for those vacationers interested in seeing the sights in and around the downtown area. Many tours leave directly out of this hotel, as well. All in all, the hotel was a good choice for those desiring a reasonably priced, nice place to hang their hat while sightseeing or otherwise spending time in downtown Chicago.",

        "content": "The Palmer House is an historic hotel located in the center of the downtown loop area. It is a block from the art museum, park on the lake and very close to most major downtown theatres, greek town, and the Golden Mile. It is a grand beautiful old hotel with a magnificent lobby. The service is fantastic. Philippe at the concierge desk couldnâ€™t have been more helpful, and my check in attendant was equally wonderful. The rooms could use upgrading to join the rest of the hotels in the 21st century, like flat screen tv's and wireless telephones. The room was great. Although, I must say, in our party of three, the sizes of the rooms varies, so ask for a big room. One of our party was in a room so small they could barely get their suitcase in, but my room was huge, with a hallway to the bathroom. As a Hilton Honors member, I received free internet discounted gym entrance and the opportunity to partake of the free breakfast and happy hour snacks every day. I am HH Gold. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The TV is not even a flat screen old style. It is a relic, and sat far from my bed, making it tough to see. There was no coffee maker, but they are available upon request. The room safe was big enough for the largest of computers. There are very nice amenities in the bathroom. Water pressure was perfect and the water was hot. The downside of this hotel is the extra charge situation. Everything costs extra. There is no mini-bar because they want you to order from room service. Coffee is $8 plus $2 delivery charge and 21% service charge, plus tax. The gym is $10, internet starts at $14.99 for a few hours and $19.99 for a day. A scotch in the bar was $17 with tax and tip. There are plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood like Au Bon Pain which has a great lunch. You can watch your favorite TV show if you missed its initial run for $4.99 and movies are available at a much higher cost. I highly recommend the Palmer House Hilton. Itâ€™s a wonderful old hotel, just watch your wallet!",

        "content": "My cousin and I stayed here over New Year. The 'el' was so close to the hotel, you can hear it. It's fine once you get used to it, but needs a little adjustment before you do. Our room was lovely, mainly I think because we had a corner room which made it light and airy, with a view down to the lake. Also, because we had two beds, whihc meant it was reasonably sized. We heard a lady in the elevator complaining about the size of here room and when we went past a room beign serived and could see inside it, it did seem quite small. The bathroom was good with great products, the bedding was lovely and the location was fabulous. Most things were well within walking distance. There are plenty of places to eat close by, so no need to starve here. Our complaints were around the lack of... no kettle for tea or coffee making in the room. Why? And wifi was available, but at the most rediculous prices! It was something like Â£14.99 for basic (good enough to check your emails) a DAY or Â£19.99 for the faster stuff. As my cousin said - how come most of the coffee shops provide free access while you sip your $2 coffee, yet hotels charging huge amounts of money can't offer the same service? I'd advise you to go for a coffee to check your emails! Our other complaint was about the pool area. the pool is TINY, no changing facilities and the jaccussi was out of order for our whole trip, which was rubbish. We were really looking forward to a nice soak after a lot of walking and were hugely disappointed that it wasn't in working order. That aside though, we had a nice visit. The hotel lobby is as amazing as everyone says - but all manner of people can wander in and out of the area unchallenged, so make sure you lock everything up okay. We recomend the gage, which is on Michigan Avenue for a lovely meal. And finally, you can print your boarding passes out in the buisness centre for free :) The rest of the internet charges are high in there, but it was great to be able to pop in and print off my boarding pass with no hassle at all.",

We did Tea Time and Dinner with them. Ask for Javier. If you can, buy the Parking package as parking is expensive especially if you're staying more than one night. Locatrion was great. We walked to Michigan avenue for shopping. The room was excellent. We had 2 bathroom and closets which was prefect. The bed was very comfortable. The only issue we had was the sound-proofing as we could occationally hear people above us moving furniture, but it is an older hotel. Overall it was an amazing weekend.",

        "content": "I stayed here for three nights in October while I was attending a conference, and enjoyed the experience very much. I had booked a pretty cheap rate (it was under $200) and after reading on here that some of the rooms were quite small, I decided to try for the e-upgrade that the Hilton offers in their email confirmations. The one I ended up with was on one of the two executive level floors, and I paid $35.00 a night for the upgrade, which I believe was well worth it. When I checked in I was a little taken aback by the long check-in line, but it moved very quickly. The person checking me in didn't mention my e-upgrade request, so I asked about it and he checked around and found me a room on the 22nd floor. I liked staying on the executive level. It had dedicated elevators, and what elevators they were! They were very old-fashioned, and had an upholstered leather bench to sit on in case you got weary on your ride up. My room itself was very good-sized, it had two double beds and a sitting area with a TV and a comfortable but very worn easy chair, a chair and desk and two tiny bathrooms. I have to say though, I literally laughed out loud when I walked in the room because the interior design was so old-fashioned. The beds were covered with elaborate, tapestry-like covers and the elaborate draperies looked like they came from Marie Antoinette's boudoir. I did check out the hospitality suite on the 23rd floor that was for the executive level guests one night, and it was quite impressive. They had a full bar (non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary) and an amazing spread of hot and cold snacks, including things like cheese and crackers, eggrolls, hummis, etc. I ordered room service a few times and it always came around the time they said it would. I would say the room-service food at this hotel was a cut-above the fare you usually get at this type of hotel. My favorite part of staying here was the lobby, it was just breathtaking, and I don't think I ever walked through it without a big smile on my face. I had lunch in the restaurant just off the lobby one day and really enjoyed it. This hotel seems to be the hub of a lot of activity in Chicago. One day I walked outside to see a huge police presence, and found out that former President Clinton was speaking at a fundraiser at the hotel that day. I later passed the concierge desk and overheard the concierge assisting a guest with getting tickets to an event the First Lady was holding there in the future. Overall I fully enjoyed staying here, but it's not for everyone. I can think of a few close friends who I would never recommend this place to, because they prefer modern W-type hotels. But if you like grand old places, give it a try!",

Amazing service, views, location, food, drink etc. Staff very friendly and weather was very good for 2 weeks in October (Only 1 day of stormy rain) transfer was very quick (Independent travel agent) only 6 people in mini bus. Best of all though our 2 year old daughter loved it. Regardless of which side you stay in, the hotel is big and the jungle in between makes for and interesting diversion on the way to getting food (Our favourite Chinese), bar service was good and it's easy to forget the bars by reception where service was always fast. Really would recommend this hotel to anyone. ** Room service included in an AI is really something you don't find in many other AI for this price **",

        "content": "This was our 3rd Riviera Maya trip, second to an Iberostar, and first to the Quetzal. I'll avoid repeating what you'll find in most of the positive reviews here - the info provided here is quite accurate. Read about 15-20 reviews and you'll get the idea. A few people will find problems, but I suspect they are quite hard to please folks. We traveled with a group of our closest friends; 10 couples, all 30- to 40-somethings for a no-kids getaway for 4 nights. The thing that stands out the most for me is the service - the people at the Iberostar do their best to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. A few examples: 1) For our group, we were allotted 1 \"reservation\" for a 4 night stay. Not only were we able to get all 20 into a seating at the Japanese restaurant (even though they couldn't get us at the same table), we also managed to dine with big groups in the restaurants every single night. We just had to check with the concierge later in the day, and they did what they could to accommodate us. Steak house and Mexican were nice alternatives to the buffet (which was just fine as well.) Japanese is always fun - our group had both the top chef (most experienced), and the \"new guy\" who was shaking as it was his 4th time! no worries, food and fun was good. The \"sake\" was questionable, but fun to share anyway. 2) We are football fans, and our hometown team was playing on Sunday on TV. There isn't really a TV/sports bar anywhere on resort, but after asking the front desk, the StarFriends were engaged to help us out. They managed to open up the Disco (which has flat-screen TVs) and tune the game in for us. We were the only ones in the empty place, but they left us to enjoy. They even sent the bartender from the main bar over to check on us for drinks every so often - incredible service! Hats off - this is what I've come to expect from Iberostar. 3) The pool \"closes\" at dusk, but one night we were a bit rowdy and having a good time as a group. Security came by to check on us, but just to see that all was well and left us to enjoy the evening. They could have hassled us, but once they saw we were just having a good time, they gave us some smiles and moved on. (Well, maybe they were just checking out our wives, but that's cool too :) 4) Service staff will help in any way they can. Waiters kept an eye on us in the restaurants to bring special shots; bartenders would mix anything we wanted, and even put it in our insulated cups we brought. If you think the drinks aren't strong enough, just ask for an extra shot - they're happy to oblige! Whether you tip or not, they provide the same great service. However, as others have pointed out - these people work HARD so you can forget your troubles. Definitely bring some $$, turn 'em into pesos, and spread the wealth - even though they don't let on, you know they appreciate it. All in all another great Mexican trip. It's not a 5-star experience like you'd have in Vegas (food, accommodations) but it gets a 5-star rating for me for the experience that it is. In Vegas, you'd pay for 1 meal what it costs here for a whole day of food, drinks, and your room! Take some friends and go have a blast - the economy must be keeping the big crowds away.",

        "content": "To start we got this vacation at a great deal due to concerns over the swine flu and traveled with 19 people, however this wasn't even close to any reported cases the staff. The staff were great, and the restaurants were great as well. Whenever you want something they will get it for you immediately, or the staff will before you even think of it. The only things I didn't like was that during the day there was plenty to due with pool, beach, and booked excursions which I was able to do straight through the hotel in the main lobby at a reasonable price (swim with dolphins, horseback riding, visit to Chitzhen Itza, and snorkeling), however at night there is really not much to do. What I mean is that each day they have one show that lasts for hours on varying things, and they are NOT VERY GOOD partly because there are too many kids around to conduct audiences for the mature audiences. Kids under 18 will probably be very very bored at night, there were probably six children in our party who fell into this category who were complaining every night because there was nothing to do, this includes a 17 year old who was not able to hang out at the clubs at night with his brothers and sister, and cousins who are over 18. This group was not able to go into either category and I wish the hotel would provide something for them, Lucy's kid's club did events that were for very young audiences (under 7). Also there is an actual jungle inside the hotel, where howler monkeys, peacocks, cuccobarrows, turtles, flamingoes and lot of animals roamed free which was amazing to be in. Overall I really enjoyed this vacation, and really was an all inclusive, I never needed to have money on me during my stay since everything was included. The only thing I ask is that you tip the staff, who are always hardworking, most are Mexican and speak little English, but they try their best to please. Please visit",

        "content": "Funjet had this hotel w/airfare for less than $400 for 4 nights any day the end of June, so who couldn't resist the price? We have previously traveled to the Excellence in the Domenican twice and once to Cozumel on Carnival Cruise. The hotel was nice and clean. We had requested a non-smoking room on the first floor close to the beach. All were met, but the non-smoking, however like some reviews we could not tell that it was a smoking room, the bedding did not smell like smoke but also had to wait 2 hrs before getting the keys. A positive, was that the people on the beach actually walked away when you told them \"no thanks\" (tour people & hotel spa). We tipped the maid, and tried to give some to the bar tenders just $1, which they seemed way over excited about, apparently the whole 'all inclusive' takes effect because we noticed no one else tipping. We have been to other all inclusive but always tipped because we realized that an extra $1 or two really helps their low salary. One of the negatives would have to be the dinning arrangements (besides the taste of the cheap drinks and no bottled water available at bars to take to the beach). Depending on your stay is how many reservations you get. Well since we were 4 nights so we got 1 reservation. We tried to go back the other days at 4pm when they had openings open to everyone, but they would never have a table for 3 and the lady would not sit us at a table of 4. I guess as long as you are a party of 2 or 4 you should be ok, but we were really burned out on the buffet food, its pretty much the same for lunch and dinner, and after a day, its just too much. It would not have bothered us as much if our other trips had required the same, but the other all inclusive we have been to did not make you have a reservation, but this hotel feeds the Tucan and Quatel so I think they do not have enough room to do so. Highlights we liked outside of hotel: the $5 cab ride downtown to 5th ave where all the rest. (senor frogs) shops (cheap ones and also retail like diesel). The dolphin encounter was worth the $150 for my husband and 5yr old, and we also went to Xel-ha which was like a snorkel park. Both were worth the price and it was nice to leave to see the town. All of the staff in guest contact positions seemed to speak English well. Didn't use the kid club, never really saw any kids in it. Overall, we can't complain because of the deal we got on it, but next time we would rather spend more and not have to deal with reservations to eat and the atmosphere of the employee that hates their job but its a paycheck attitude. Although Cancun had a/c and concrete roads, we love Punta Cana way more. The hotel staff seemed to be a better/friendly mood, and they were able to bargain more out in town because they needed what ever money they could get. We felt that some stuff in Playa Del Carmen was over priced and they didn't seem to care if you left they were not that desperate to try to make a deal with you. So would I recommend it, sure if you get a good price. Ours was cheaper than Sea World or Disney and it included food & drinks. I can't imagine being there more than 5 days, we were bored. Getting a tan is great but it was hard for my son to play in the water. The waves were rough, and the rocks don't really stop the 'break' but that is a mother nature problem. Just take some extra $ to do some stuff, even the guy at the tour counter at the hotel said to make sure not to use your Credit Card unless you can see them swipe it. So we just pulled $ out of the atm, the front desk will break/exchange your $ for free.",

We watched the monkeys walk along the cover walk's roof line before climbing into the trees. There were loud but only a few calls in the morning. The flamingos weren't that bad where we were either. The annoying noise was from the entertainment that went past 11pm. It was very loud even with our patio door closed. We didn't attend any of the shows and from the sound carried to our room we didn't miss much. Food was good. There was a wide enough variety that we had plenty to choose from and ate well. We spent most of our time at the beach which like other posts have said it has eroded. It looked different each day we were there. There were attempts to pump sand back up to the beach to keep it in place. Some of the resorts along the beach faired far worse for beach erosion than this one.",

(including people from our own group) the throw us in the water and tell us to swim to reef to fish 45 minutes and we are still swimming and now exhausted and we are still not there. we ask for a boat to take us back to the shore and we are still on our diesel smelling boat but now a larger boat is tugging us to shore while they are making fun of us. god aweful experience......",

        "content": "Most of the reviews I have read on here are pretty accurate. The people that gave this hotel low marks were probably comparing it to a 4 or 5 star hotel which doesn't make a lot of sense. I'll just touch the highlights of what we liked and didn't like. We stayed at the Quetzal from 10/7 to 10/12 and overall we had a great time. My wife and I brought our three year old with us and met another couple there with there three year old. Ok so here are main points: * Restaurants and food were great. Don't know what some people were talking about about the food being bad. The two pool restaurants did have lower quality food and a smaller selection than the bigger buffet and sit down restaurants though and we did get tired of eating there. The hours were kind of weird though. They are kind of set up more like cruise line with regards to having set hours for meals. Got to the restaurants other than the pool ones and you can't go wrong. * Drinks--This one was a biggie for me. One of the reasons you pay for all-inclusive is to get your drinks and not have to worry about getting nickled and dimed to death. Three things I did not like about the drinks: 1) They were VERY watered down. You could ask for more liquor but it was a pain and hit and miss. Very annoying and obvious. 2) The drinks were poorly mixed and inconsistent. Depending upon which bar you went to and which bartender you got could mean the difference between a lemon icee and a mediocre Margarita. 3) You usually had to get your own drinks. Other resorts I have stayed at (4 or 5 star) constantly had people walking around asking you if you wanted another drink--you never even had to get up. Here you spent a good deal of time waiting in line for poorly mixed drinks. * Service was impeccable. These people really go out of there way to help wherever they can. If you throw them a few extra bucks for tips (especially you chambermaid) it goes a long way towards added service. * Grounds were awesome with all the animals and they were neatly manicured. Great pool and beach. The hotels next to us which were a higher class had their beaches destroyed by the last hurricane and hadn't taken time to rebuild them. The Quetzal beach was well kept to say the least. * Clientele was largely European. Many of them are heavy smokers and in my opinion, rude and inconsiderate. We were hanging out at the childrens' show and all these Europeans were puffing away with all these little kids around. Not to mention the topless women on the beach (many of whom should not have been, in my opinion). It really made pictures with my daughter challenging to make sure some of these people were not in the background. Thankfully they were not allowed to go topless at the pool. * The beds--This deserves its own section. These things were more than just firm. Basically a super firm mattress on a block of concrete and really small uncomfortable pillows. If you stay here I would suggest you bring your own pillow. We requested an egg crate but they were out and gave us another blanket which did not help enough. I know I stated a lot of negatives here, but for a three star hotel we were pretty happy. Mostly just the drink thing irked me. Overall I would recommend this place for families and couples.",

Hurricane Dean tried to ruin it for us, but we stayed through it all and were only inconvenienced 1 day, glad we stayed.Quite exciting to be part of that whole ordeal. We all thoroughly enjoyed everything about Iberostar. The food was great. I must say after reading complaints about the buffet, we found no problems with the huge variety. Our fav's were the Italian and the Mexican restaurants. The rooms were always clean, and fridge restocked, if you want great service try tipping these hard working folks. It's worth a few $ each day to show your appreciation. It seems like the drinks were a bit weak but you could drink beer and wine for the full effect. The bar on the beach and the one in the hotel lobby were the most accommodating. The shows in the evening were a bit on the corny side, but fun to watch. The beach was awesome and the pool was great. Get up early to reserve chairs at both. Nearby, Xel Ha was a disappointment for snorkeling. Ruins: Tulum ok, take the time to visit Chichen Itxa. We'll be going back next spring for sure!",

        "content": "This was our fifth trip to Playa Del Carmen, but our first with our son who is 1 year old. And, I have to say, unfortunately, the first time we have been to a resort in Playa which we were unhappy with. After much research, we decided to stay at the IB Quetzal, mainly because it has the reputation of being such a family friendly resort. Travelling with such a young child, we wanted to be sure they had areas and pools just for small children. We were not impressed. The pools are hot and almost unbearable at times (this was especially true for the kiddie pool), and unless you get up early and reserve a lounge chair by the pool or beach (which it technically not allowed) you will probably spend most of your day with no where to sit. I have never had this problem at a 4 or 5 star resort in Playa or anywhere else for that matter. Next is the food. Now, I am a picky eater. However, on our previous trips to Mexico (9 total) I have never had this much trouble finding something that seemed edible. My husband is not a picky eater at all, and he found a few things he liked, and ate the same things all week. Their breakfast and lunch buffets are the same daily, so don't expect a change. There were a couple of evenings when dinner was good. Other than that, we spent our time on 5th avenue for dinner. The rooms are large and spacious, however the beds are the hardest I have ever felt. We called and requested an egg crate pad, and truly don't think we could've made it through the week without it! It was like sleeping on a concrete bench! One more note...our power went out in our room 3 times!!!! Twice early in the morning, and once when we were getting ready for dinner. Luckily we had friends a few doors down, and we finished getting ready in their room. There is just no excuse for this at this type of resort. The only explanation I received was \"sorry\". While the property is beautiful and well maintained, it leaves much to be desired. In our experience it just isn't up to Iberostar standards, and with so many choices in the Playa/Playacar area we won't be going back here again. I know many people love this place, it just wasn't for us!",

        "content": "We just got back from the Iberostar Quetzel with our three teenagers, ages 16, 17, and 19 on June 6th. Everyone had a great time and loved the Quetzal. The beach was great, plenty of chairs and palapas, and if you could not get a palapa, you could easily get an umbrella from the towel hut with no problem. We LOVED the jungle part of the hotel! It was nice to walk by it every day and see all the animals - monkeys, peacocks, Swans, Peking ducks, flamingoes, etc - in fact, that is why I booked this hotel because it was so different. The people that work here are such hard-working people - you never saw any of the help just sitting around, and it showed, because the hotel was very clean. The rooms were comfortable, the beds were very hard, but I'm used to it at home, so it wasn't a problem. We always came back from the beach with a very clean room and with towel art on the bed and flower petals etc. It was a nice touch. My husband and I went to the Riviera Maya for the first time in February and stayed at another hotel. The Iberostar is a MUCH better choice all around. The food was much better too. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and the Steakhouse. Both were good choices. Our kids, who are not adventurous eaters, had to be convinced that there would be more than just Sushi at the Japanese restaurant. They were pleasantly surprised. In fact, it was their favorite restaurant. Breakfast was the best at Cozumel, we thought, so we ate there every day. The buffets by the pool were OK, still better than the other hotel we stayed at, and some of the selections changed every day, which was nice. We went outside the hotel on a few 1/2 day excursions. We did the jet ski/snorkeling trip one day (my favorite), and the speedboat/ATV another day (my teenagers' favorite). My husband and daughter played beach volleyball, and we took a Catamaran out one day with a guide. (Renting a Catamaran is free unless you have a guide come with you, which we did and were glad we did.) The Star Friends are an amazing group of kids - they were always doing something or trying to get a volleyball or horseshoes game going, or exercise, yoga or dance. If you're bored at this place, it's your own fault! One more thing I liked about staying in the Riviera Maya is that there are so many Europeans that visit this area and we enjoyed meeting so many of them! They were from the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, England etc. It's nice to meet other people from other countries. All in all it was a wonderful trip and I would definitely stay there again, especially if I take my family.",

        "content": "After having researched a few different hotels in the area of Playacar we settled on the Iberostar Quetzal based on the reviews I had read from Trip Advisor. Let me say that we made a very good choice based on the group we were travelling with. We stayed at the resort from April 9-16 we a group of 6 people (2 grandparents, myself and my husband and our 2 year old and my brother and sister-in-law (who is seven months pregnant). The check in was good and the resort is really nice for families and especially younger children. My son loved the peacocks that roamed the resort and the different variety of other birds. We also saw several monkeys hanging from the trees on many occasions. The rooms were not as luxurious as some other resorts we have stayed at when it was just me and my husband, but overall were very clean and large enough for everyone. We lucked out having actually received a true king size bed in our room that comfortably slept the 2 of us and our son. We did ask for a mattres pad however, since we did find the bed quite hard. This helped a little bit. I wouldn't recommend using their cribs if you have little ones, only because the mattress they use in them is literally paper thin with just a wood bottom. I imagine this would be very uncomfortable for a young child. Pools: the large pool that was for everyone was very nice. My son played at the entry to the pool and had a great time. There is a kiddie wading pool, but it didn't seem that clean and they have used these very slippery tiles to build it, which is pretty to look at but very slippery for small feet. There was never usually an issue to find shaded areas and loungers around the pool side, but we always had a spot picked by early morning. Also, the resort did not appear to be full this week. Beach: was absolutely great. I have been to seven mile beach in Negril in 2002 and this was the closest I have seen any other beach compare to it. It was white sand, quite large and went down to clear turquoise waters. Shaded loungers and palapas were hard to find in the afternoon, but go in the morning and no problem. The waves were quite strong on a few of the days that we were there, but were great fun for the adults to play in. My son also enjoyed the water on a couple of calmer days. This was the reason we picked this resort and were not disappointed. The beaches to all of the other resorts to our left, RIU Palace Mexico, RIU Palace Playacar, and all of the rest have literally no beaches left. It appears that when they built these resorts they made man-made beaches but ocean has taken back the land. Food: Buffet was just so-so, about what I had expected from everyone else's reviews. They had a large selection, but none of it was very impressive or tasty. We dined in all of the a la carte restaurants though and found that this food did taste better. I would definitely recommend the steak house. It's not as good as a typical steak house such as the Keg, but all in all there are many choices and it tasted pretty good. One thing that bothered us about the reservation system though was that they would only seat half of the restaurant. We were able to book all of our spots on the first day that we arrived, but on the second evening we were told that there were no reservations. We asked if we could go to one of them and wait the 15 min to see if another group did not show up (they tell you your spot will only be held for 15mins when you make a reservation) but the guest services told us \"Well you can try but I dobut they will seat you anyways.\" It seems like they don't want to staff these restaurants and force you to eat in buffet. I realize they have different seatings 6:30 or 7:00 and then 8:30 or 9:00 but I am saying that even when these seatings had passed you could walk in to any a la carte place and they would be less than 1/2 full. The night that we were at the steak house the maitre'd told us we could come any night and basically as long as we tipped him, we could have a seat at any time of the night. Word of caution, they charge high rates to use the phones in your room and even at the pay phone they want to charge you $5.00 US to make a call with a calling card that you purchase locally. Internet access is the same way. I would definitely recommend walking down the street 5 minutes to the little shopping plaza and buying a phone card there. It will work on any of the public phones there. Also, there are stores with internet access which charge about $1.50 for 15 minutes of internet use. Also, this resort is in a gated community which is very safe. We would take walks down to the shopping centre at night after dinner with my little one and felt completely secure. You can actually walk into Playa del Carmen if you want to, it would take about 20 mins at a leisurely pace. The shows were OK and the drinks were good too. You could always have your daiquiris made with back shelf rums. The ice cream parlour at the beach was good too. I used room service a couple of times when my son was napping and the food is basic, (hamburgers, pizza, chicken nuggets) but arrived quickly and hot. Would I stay here again? With my family probably, as a couple no. There are too many other beautiful places to try out.",

We got reservations in all the a la carte restaurants and particularly enjoyed the Japenese ( we managed to get in there 3 times!!) and the Mexican ( twice) although they were all very nice. I just hope Wilma hasn't damaged any of the hotel and grounds and that the people we left there managed to get home safely.

Good entertainment every night at the show, and of course later in the night you have to go to the club, Mascara.

Theres even wildlife running around in a jungle in the middle of the resort, but none of them woke me up early like some frinds told me would happen.

        "content": "My husband & myself & 2 daughters, aged 11 & 13, stayed at the Quetzal in April with 3 other families and had a wonderful vacation!! The weather was perfect, the pool was clean and lovely (there's really just one large pool and an adult swim-up/bar pool), the staff was very attentive and polite, the rooms were spartan but clean and the food was wonderful. The beds are not as hard as other reviews may claim. My only complaint about the rooms is that there is construction going on at the hotel next door and I really didn't want to hear that kind of noise on my vacation. Go to Walmart or Target and buy inexpensive floats for the pool. You can then leave them for another family. As far as the restaurants are concerned, the three we went to were great. The Japanese is a Benihana style restaurant, which was fun and delicious. The Mexican was okay-it was nice to be served dinner instead of going to the buffet, but the kids decided they'd prefer the buffet over the menu choices. Food was so-so. The Steak House restaurant was very good. The buffet was always excellent for breakfast and dinner. The poolside restaurant is great for a very casual lunch (wear your swimsuit). The \"Star Friends\" are the on-site group of performers who put on a different show every night. They even have a children's performance every night, and our little friends we were vacationing with (aged 4, 6 & 7) were in a couple of the performances. The Star Friends come around the pool and beach during the day and encourage the children to come rehearse for an hour and then are in a cute show that night. After this portion of the show, there is an audience participation segment and then a different themed show performed by the Star Friends. It gets long but is fun. My husband & I went to Tuluum for an excursion. (No one else in our party was interested). It was about a 40 minute ride each way, and well worth it to see Mayan ruins. We booked this trip in the hotel lobby, and had to walk about 5 minutes up the street to Playacar to catch our Tour bus. It was very organized and worth the trip. Our friends went swimming with the dolphins & loved it. The 4 adult men in our party went deep sea fishing and caught a big one! Our family went on a snorkelling excursion, also booked through the hotel lobby. We went to two places for 45 minutes each to snorkel - a shallow spot where we barely saw any fish, and to deep water, where we felt like we were in \"Finding Nemo\". The boat crew was polite and helpful, and at the end of the trip we sat in an a covered outdoor restaurant where we had complimentary beer and soft drinks and a mariacchi band serenaded us. The beach at the Quetzal was beautiful. If you walked down the beach a bit there was a huge water trampoline which cost $10 per day. The catamarans at the Quetzal were a blast, and do not cost extra. Be careful if it's too windy, though. Parasailing and banana boat rides were available for a fee. Walk to Playacar (5 min away) to shop. Taxi ($4)to Playa del Carmen for hairbraiding & additional shopping.",

Hotel has all amenities of exquzite chain hotels with coziness of small privately owned places. Hotel architecture with water falls, natural trails in rain forest environment will create an impression that you are in wild area safari. Rooms are large, all with balconies, all air-conditioned. All services, food, nightly entertainment are of excellent qualities. Service personal are extremely friendly and ready to help. Unfortunately I can not say that this property is a hidden treasure because many people already know this place but I wanted to right down my experience to support that fact. When my family and my clientele wants to relax under the sun by the sea I can not recommend any better place and most of my clientele including myself are repeated guests at this property. I just hope that prices for its all inclusive packages stay as competitive and affordable as others in this area of Cancun. Discounts International Travel St. Louis, MO USA Owner",

        "content": "Just got back from the IB Quetzal and I wish I were still there! I go to many wonderful restaurants and have traveled quite a bit. I thought the food was fantastic. I never had one thing I really didnt like. The have quite the variety - mexican of course at most meals...some the same and some different each time. Always lots of bread, pastries to die for. I loved the fresh donuts with filling and the kids loved the powdered rolls. I became attached to the Chiquiles at breakfast (like a mexican lasagna only with corn tortilla instead of noodles) and the bananna milk! The hostess kindly told me how they are made so I can try it at home. Several kinds of eggs every morning and always french toast- that was great, pancakes and waffles. Omelets made special for you. The wait staff were friendly and excellent. We usually ate lunch by the pool. The paella party was great, they always had hot dogs and burgers as well as a whole line of other buffet items. There was always some place to eat or snack open. We ate at the steakhouse which was great. We also ate at the Bonsai Japanese, which was good too, it does take a while and they were somewhat disorganized but it was good. Our seafood night we had shirmp not lobster, but these shrimp were HUGE and the best I have had, sweet and I thought they were about as close to lobster as you could get. The rooms were nice, and the only time we spent there was to sleep. Which brings me to mention, the beds, they are firm but I thought they were comfortable. I was so tired each night I could have slept on the tile floor. Maids did a great job, cute towel art. I left 2.00/day plus a gift of make-up etc. I heard they liked that. The resort was spotless, there were friendly folks working constantly to keep it nice. We loved the jungle, the animals. One day we had 8 monkeys above us in the trees. Very neat to watch. The resort peole bring the Parrots and the Iguanas around to the pool and beach and take photos and sell them in the photo shop. Those are my favoriye photos even if they were 7.00/ea. We enjoyed the drinks and ice cream at the pool bar, there was always something going on if you wanted to join. The kids club caters to younger kids....Id say between 4 and 7 were the majority. My kids are 8 and 12. The 8 yr old did go several times and participated in the play Grease. It was the cutest thing!!! He had a blast. They played tennis, never had a problem getting a court, basketball, air rifle contest, ping pong. They met kids from all over. Had a wonderful time / we were there from dec 13-19. It was not crowded until the last 2 days. Then the holiday crowd showed up. The weather was great, just right low 80s and a nice breeze. We had 2 red-flag days where there were no water sports. I would recommend if you want to do watersports, you do them the first chance you get because you never know if the next day will be a red flag day. We signed up for parasail/reef snorkel/bananna boat at the white kiosk on the far left side of the property. (red and white sign) We only paid 58.00 pp for a parasail/snorkel/bananna boat combo. Which was cheaper than other offers. Parasail was awesome. SNorkel would have been but it got rough while we were out there and visability wasnt good. They kindly let me trade bananna boat for paddle boat so I could let my youngest enjoy as well. If you want to catamaran on property, if you dont have experience you must take a lesson for 38.00 then you can do it for 1 hr per day each day. I recommend you take the class at the beginning of the week then you can take advantage of your time to use the boat. Pool water was cool, hot tub same temp as pool. Ocean water was warmer than pool. It rained a few times for a short while but nothing bothersome. We took a cab into Playa twice. 4USD each way. There are also shops 5 min walk away. We ate ice and drank on the property all week, NO PROBLEM with tummy aches!!! I definitely recommend this for families. Not really for honeymooners as much . I wouldnt recommend high heels as they may get stuck in the teakwood walkways. I dont wear them, just a bit of advice. I really enjoyed this. It was my first experience with all inclusive. Its the only way to go escpecially w kids!!! I would go back in a minute. I think as far as the resort property the next place I go will seem like the Super 8!!! If you ahve any questions, feel free to ask.",

In response to the people who complained about the food always being the same in the buffet resturants, when there is just about everything you could wish for in the resturant, how can you want varity, you could eat there every night for your entire holiday and not eat the same meal twice. The best excursion we went on was the jungle crossing, (booked thru the hotel shop) you swim in underground caves on a mayan ranch, where you also eat a traditional mexican lunch (delicious).Then taken to the most beautiful deserted beach to kayak and snorkel around a coral reef. and enjoy fresh fruit and cold drinks on the beach on our return We had a wicked guide called Nachos and shared the day with an American family who had children of similar ages, what lovely people, all I can say is it was the most perfect day and we will remember it for ever, a word of warning though, the army jeep ride once on the ranch is NOT for the faint hearted nor those with a queasy stomach but what fun if you have the chance this is a day not to be missed We all really enjoyed the holiday and would go back to this hotel again tomorrow, the people are lovely always smiling especially rosario in the tucan lobby bar, the food is great we all came home fatter then when we went and the place is spotless Nothing is too much trouble If there is one down side its the music in the disco its either really naf 70,s (grease lightening and the bee gee's staying alive ) or trance so please mr deejay lighten up some current dance tunes would be good.",

We have visited 10 different all-inclusive resorts in Mexico over the years and this one by far had the best food. The evening buffet was much better than I expected after reading the reviews. The presentation was great, flavor was delicious and the variety great as well. The dinner buffet was uncomfortably warm since there was no breeze coming through, but that was our only complaint with the food or dining areas. The resort was very crowded, both on the beach and by the pool and we didn't find the staff all that friendly. Although there were plenty of activities ongoing, my kids would not go participate on their own. We were there for 7 days and saw plenty of \"star friends\" walk by us all day long, but only once did they speak to my children. At other resorts we have stayed at we always end up making friends with at least one of the resort hosts. The bartenders gave good, fast service, but once again were not overly friendly. The resort was packed with Europeans and most of them extremely rude! There were also many topless women on the beach as well. At one time from where we were sitting on the beach we could see 6 topless women. The room was clean but small for four of us. We asked for an upgrade to a Jr. Suite when we checked in and they could not accomodate us. There are only a handful of Jr. Suites and they are the only rooms that have full beach views. Although the resort, jungle and beach were beautiful, we would not stay here again. We were actually homesick by about the 4th day, something I have never experienced while on vacation before.",

We have also traveled to Maui. We enjoyed the IQ very much. It was a lovely resort. The service we received was always excellent and with a smile. On Tuesday, the day we arrived we had our first meal at the main buffet. It was OK. The food on Wednesday was also OK. On Thursday, and throughout the week the food was excellent. Did they have better cooks the rest of the week? We made our dinner reservations at the Italian and the Steak restaurants. They were both very good meals. We both enjoyed the steak restaurant more. We felt the drinks were always excellent. The rooms were always cleaned early in the morning. I did request a room in building 21 on the 2nd or 3rd floor, with a king size bed. All of my request were met. I liked building 21 because it was close to the pool and beach. The only complaint I have about our room was the refrigerator was not very cold. They stocked our drinks daily. We did not leave the resort often. We enjoyed the resort so much, we did not want to venture out. We did one excursion with Alltournative Tours. We did their jungle tour. It was a wonderful adventure. We both enjoyed it very much. I believe Alltournative Tours is a reputable company but I did have one problem that occured. I had done a lot of research before our vacation, I had read a trip review or a travel forum, I don't remember, someone had booked a tour with Alltournative on their web. When the date arrived for their tour, they raised the rates on them. I booked my tour on line and made sure and printed the itinerary and the price along with save 10% if reserve on line. 24 hours before our excursion I went to our Lomas rep. to see if they would call for us to confirm our reservations, the lomas rep tried to tell me it was $20 more per person, than my printed copy. I don't know if Lomas or Alltournative was trying to get an extra $40.00 from us. I was greatful I had read that information before we left for our trip. I could have been in the same predicament as the previous traveler, but because I made a copy of the price, they had to honor it. The Iberostar Quetzal has a wonderful beach and a beautiful pool. I found the guests and staff to all be friendly. It was a terrific vacation. I would definitely stay there again.",

From the high end steak house, Hyde Park, to a great sports bar. It's convienent to most things, and the staff is very helpful and friendly. I wanted to check in early, and they were very good at getting a room cleaned to allow me to do so. Will stay there again when in Daytona.",

        "content": "I picked this hotel after reading reviews for it versus other hotels in same area. It did not disappoint. First, it's huge. The combination of South and North Towers and all the restaurants make this a great place to stay and a good daily walk! Check in was a breeze, got a room after 5 mins and I was early at 12:00pm!! Got straight to the room, nice average hotel room with an amazing view of the ocean and all the happenings that go on around this hotel. Had a problem with AC and had repairman there in 10 mins after the call and he went out of his way to fix problem and give me some tourist advice. Beautiful beaches and so many fun things to do around this hotel , that I would stay again. My rooms were clean, the hotel was clean and I had great service the entire trip. Made a girls weekend great!! Tips for this hotel:: stay oceanfront, it is definitely worth the extra money. Also check out earlier than the 11:00am checkout. We waited for a long time for bell service and our car . I've heard we had over 200 rooms checking out at one time. A possible solution for the hotel would be staggering check out times to ease the wait. Otherwise I enjoy the hotel and will be coming back with my family to stay again.",

        "content": "We went here for a conference a couple weeks ago. The website made the property look real nice, but in this case perception was not total reality. The lobby and reception area along with the conference facilities were nice and some had been redone/renovated recently. We had a cabana room since we were travelling with little ones and needed the extra space. We got the rooms for the conference special price so it was in line with what we are used to paying for a room but I would not have paid \"retail\" for it. As for in room amenities, there were none. The TVs were older, no microwave, and the furniture a little dated. We had to pay $10 a night for a mini fridge. In it's heyday this was a jewel on Daytona Beach, and it still had some of its old glory but the shine had faded.. Being oceanfront by the boardwalk and next to the Ocean Walk Village was really cool. Having a place to sit outside in the evenings and chat and watch fireworks and listen to the band in the band-shell was neat too. I've stayed at less pricey hotels on the beach or near the beach (like across the street) that were way nicer for the money, even some with kitchens and true \"suite\" layouts. This property needs some updating/modernizing to compete and regain its position. Hilton as a brand has a particular reputation and I am sure if Conrad Hilton were around to see this property he would not give it very high marks at all. Would I stay here again? Maybe, for a weekend getaway sans kiddos or if the muchkins are a little older and not in cribs and on formula. I still wouldn't pay full price though...and $20/night to park is CRAZY if you pay \"retail\" for the room. Check that, it's crazy period. There's more I could say to be critical but I'll stop as I read some other review about conferences and elevators and I hate redundancy.",

        "content": "A recent conference in Daytona Beach took me to this area and the Hilton Daytona Beach. I was excited to be in Florida with warm and beautiful weather during my week stay! A few years ago I was invited to Daytona Beach to explore the possibility of bringing meetings to the area. At the time, the hotel was flagged as an Adam’s Mark. Several years ago it was rebranded to a Hilton. This is a very large hotel, located directly across Atlantic Avenue from the Ocean Center (convention center and arena), and Peabody Auditorium. The hotel itself can accommodate various size meetings. The hotel does not have shuttle service to/from the airport but there are private companies and taxis that offer airport to hotel service for approximately $18. The airport is just minutes to the hotel. I was greeted by very professional and friendly staff at the HiltonHhonors line (no waiting in the other long lines) and was off to my room in the south tower in just a few minutes. I had breakfast coupons and everything I needed for my week in Florida. My room was two double beds as no king bedrooms were available, even with my gold Honors status. There was a large group at the hotel which no doubt used many of the rooms. My guest room was showing a need for a refresh, and a bit cramped with two beds. However, the spectacular and most incredible view of the beach and ocean quickly made up for any room needs. I enjoyed the mornings rising to beautiful sunrises, and the beach. The beds were very comfortable and typical Hilton beds. The bathroom was a bit small and compact but adequate. The one problem I encountered a few days was the terrible water pressure. Later in the week it seemed to improve. I must say the staff at this hotel is superb! They greet you in the public areas and ask if they can help you with anything, or will direct you to where you need to go. One afternoon I arrived back at my room and noticed it had not been cleaned. A quick call to the hotel guest services promptly resolved the issue. I was very impressed with the hotel staff; they are some of the best in the industry. I was very impressed with the front desk/check-in staff and how helpful and friendly they were! Great people!! The breakfast coupons entitle one to the full buffet or you may order from the menu. The buffet was very good and offered the typical morning breakfast fare. Knowing I did not want or need to eat so much for breakfast each morning I opted for the menu selections on several days. The restaurant staff at “Doc Bale’s Grill” were top notch and very attentive! This venue is only open for breakfast from what I could tell. I must say the breakfast buffet seemed a bit on the high-price side at $19.95 per person. However, it does come with beverage choices and all-you-can-eat. Over all my stay was incredibly great! In fact, I had a hard time leaving! The weather, paired with being on the beach is just a bit of paradise! Other related comments about the Daytona Beach area. The Ocean Walk Village is located directly next to the Hilton, and is a complex of two hotels (including the Hilton and Wyndham) and shops. I must say this “shopping” complex is nothing more than a collection of fast-food style restaurants, with a couple retail shops. I was disappointed in what it had to offer. The shops along Atlantic Avenue are your typical beach/surfing shops that cater to the tourists. If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all as each offers the same basic line of “tourist trinkets” and clothing. If you are searching for anything in the line of local art/craft/photography, you are not going to find it along the beach area shops. Overall, my experience in Daytona Beach and at the Hilton was great! For a destination to relax and kickback, and enjoy the weather and beach, this is it! If you have a car, Orlando is just an hour away.",

I'm sure not all rooms were like this (in fact, I've stayed here before and the bed wasn't like this). It was lumpy and there were big dips from being overslept on. - Every time someone in a neighboring room closed the door, the whole room would shake and it was so loud. - Shower liner was stained with black mold and mildew. -Small tub/shower Tips: -Join Kimpton Intouch - Ask for a corner room if possible.

On the positive side, beautiful decor and comfy room and I raved about the Tulio restaurant, where I enjoyed one dinner and two breakfasts, with excellent food and attentive service, especially from the manager, Doug. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the peculiarity of only having morning coffee available in the lobby. It is good coffee, but these days, even the average motel provides good coffee in the room. The bathrroom is rather small. Since I use a breathing machine ( CPAP ) the first thing I check out is electrical outlets near the bed. This was one of those cases where the outlet was behind the mattress, and it involved some rearraging of plugs. Otherwise, even with the extension cord that I carry, it would not have reached other outlets in the room.",

We were offered a coffee-maker, which was delivered within 10 minutes of our arrival with coffee/sugar etc. all on a tray. The room was spacious with bathrobes/socks/umbrella/in-room safe inside the wardrobe, and actually had plenty of hangers as well. The bathroom had good lighting, also with all the amenities that we needed. Our king size bed was comfortable with good pillows/sheets. We liked the decor, the couch and bed were not clattered with cushions (lots of modern hotels have heaps of cushions these days, and we usually have to move them around to create more room). Our room was on the top floor, so we had a leafy outlook of the city. The wine tasting evening was a nice social occasion to meet fellow travellers, especially for the single travellers. We really enjoyed it. We joined the Kimpton Intouch, so we got free internet throughout our stay, and it was great to be able to keep in touch with friends and family. This hotel is just so unique, one has to stay there to experience the difference ! We will definitely stay there again when we are back in Seattle next.",

The upgrade to the Luxury Suite was delightful especially if you like to entertain friends. The Vintage Park is small enough that you get to know the staff quickly, yet large enough that it doesn't have that creepy B&B feel. Location is great! Easy walk around downtown or about a $10-15 cab ride anywhere else worthwhile. Seattle is not a \"hail a cab\" city so let the desk call one for you and one will be there in moments. The restaurant is pretty good, Sherry at the bar is an absolute delight and great to chat with if dining solo.

        "content": "I never usually write reviews, but I felt compelled, as we relied on so many before we booked. We had the absolute best time at Secrets Maroma! To give you some background on where our point of view comes from, my husband and I are in our mid-30's, and we were there celebrating our 11 year anniversary. We are pretty well-traveled when it comes to the Caribbean. This was my fourth trip to Mexico, and my husband’s first trip to the Mayan Riviera. We stayed from 10/1-4. As for all-inclusives we have stayed at 3 different Sandals resorts, and have had really negative experiences at 2 of the 3. However, we cannot travel as much as we'd like to, so all-inclusives are an easy way to alleviate the extra planning as far as dining and activities are concerned. This time, we decided on Mexico, and booked Secrets due to the positive reviews. We are so glad we did. And I will never give Sandals another single cent of my money now that I see how much more superior Secrets is. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, charging 2-3 times as much for such substandard accommodations and below-par service….yet, I digress. I won't break down every aspect of the resort, as this has been done. However, I would like to address some of the negative comments. First, this resort is designed in a specific Mexican style. As such it has interesting fountains and waterways, and a very clean design aesthetic. Everything has been laid out to promote the feeling of tranquility and a spa-like atmosphere. We loved this about Secrets. We aren't the type to live in the pool, as the reason we go to a beach resort is to enjoy the beach, but we were happy with the set-up of the pool areas. As for the complaints about lack of lush vegetation, again-I feel that the people complaining just don't understand the design. There was absolutely nothing brown while we were there. Quite the contrary, everything was very green and there were flowers everywhere. Short of staying in a tropical rainforest, I am not sure what these people are looking for as far as landscaping is concerned. We have been to beaches in 10-plus different Caribbean islands and I will say that this is one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever seen. The water is very clear and you can see your feet on the bottom. I suppose it gets cloudy from time to time--when a WAVE crashes the beautiful, soft SAND onto the shoreline. If that's a problem, then I am afraid there may be no pleasing you. The seaweed is minimal (and is raked away), there are pretty angel fish everywhere, and it is simply gorgeous. It was hard to stay out of the ocean. We always got a palapa in a spot we liked, the service on the beach (and everywhere else) was amazing, and we could not have been happier. There was never a crowded feel. The ashtrays are there to keep smokers from putting their butts out on the beach. As a non-smoker, I appreciated this tremendously. Basically, I know that not everyone can be pleased all of the time. There were a couple of areas that we felt could have been a little better (food variety at dinner, mainly), but I cannot say we were ever complaining. The good exponentially outweighed the less than good, and you can be sure you will have a wonderful time at this resort. Look at it this way, if the main complaints are mosquitoes (which is out of anyone's control--try Jamaica or St. Lucia if you think Mexico is bad), not enough trees, and beach ashtrays, then you really don’t have problems. Book with confidence and enjoy.",

        "content": "This resort is Wonderful. I'm still unclear why one would complain about the grounds not being tropical enough or the food being below average. We ate far better than we expected, and the place is beautifuI. I mean, come on, this place was incrediable! I won't even try to describe the breathtaking ocean view because you just can not unerstand it until you've seen for yourself. The colors of the water and sky look more like a painting. I didn't think anything could really be That Picture Perfect. My husband, better known around the pool's swim-up bar as \"Tuscaloosa\" (Johnny) and our buddies Kandy and her husband \"Alabama\" (Richard) were pampered and spoiled from the time we were picked up from the airport until we were,sadly enough, delivered back there almost a week later. We had swim-out rooms that were fantastic! Really, I would have protested had they tried to upgrade us to anything else. Yes, the A/C are below par. We spent Very Little time in our room and we're always greated with little suprises when we returned...Roses, drawn bubble baths, turn down services. (and we were not even honeymooners or anything) Please, don't be one of those Non Tippers! REALLY, These people work way too hard for you to use the excuse that it's not required. Besides, You'll be surprised at the extra attention to detail you receive when you repect the people who are working so hard to please you. The spa is a must. My husband went kicking and screaming but now is checking for local spas around our home town so we can enjoy little weenend \"pick me ups\" Ha! The swim-up bar was a blast. The event staff was great at getting a willing, and usually tipsy gang to join in on the activities. I can't say enough about the pool volleyball. Although my back picked the worst weenend EVER to go out, I laughed more in two days just watching and listening to all the funny \"smack\" talk from the guest AND event staff. If you see Fernando at pool bar, ask him to introduce you to Don Julio. We give them (Don and Fernando) honerable mentions every time we talk of our vacation !!! Please remember to take a bottle of fresh water and a little extra bite of meat and share with the stray dog at the beach. She sometimes plays in the ocean after she's been fed. Look for the man on horseback a bit south down the beach. For tips, He does a few tricks on horseback and will let you take pictures of them or he will take pixs of you on the horse..Pretty cool for photo opp. Please tell Fernando that Diane and Tuscalosoa said hello. And relax, you're gonna love it here!",

        "content": "With a wealth of hotels to choose from in the Chi area, I have sampled from the best. Many of them have been quite good, but for the past couple of years, I've opted for the Dana. Location-wise, it's just off the Magnificent Mile in the midst of everything that particular stretch has to offer. Room-wise, it's got everything I need -- they're relatively spacious, have floor to ceiling windows/Juliet balconies that afford you a great view or if it's a balcony, just some fresh air (a great alternative to air conditioning), to-die-for bathrooms situated in the middle of the room (with glass-enclosed showers that let you see out while you shower if you desire, or shades if it's privacy you want), wonderful bath amenities, and -- something I've never had at any other hotel -- hand-made chocolates/candies in their honor bar in lieu of the usual M&Ms etc. Plush bathrobes and slippers too. Room service is good (in terms of offerings and timeliness) and the food is fine. The gym is just OK, unfortunately. Rather small & cramped, there is only 1 workout bench and only a couple of machines. Earlier this week I was there with 4 other (unrelated) guests and we were falling over each other and jealously watching as soon as someone finished his/her reps or workout so we could grab the equipment before anyone else. Dana management -- this is an easy fix -- please expand. The restaurant (Aja, pronounced like the continent) is pretty good too. I've only eaten there once (there are so many choices in this neck of the woods), but when I did, the menu was varied and unusual, and the service good -- even a bit over the top (I lost count of the number of people who checked in with us to make sure everything was OK); I almost expected the chef to be next! Unless my company changes its travel policy, I expect to continue to stay here, esp if they expand the gym.",

The hotel is situated right next to the Euston station, easy access to trains, tube and buses and it is easy walk to Kings Cross and if you don't mind 10-15 walk you could walk to soho or Oxford street. Bed was comfortable. Only thing I would mark down is that only continental breakfast was available, but there are plenty options in near station.

The reception was busy when I arrived. I knew that check-in was after 3:00 and I planned my arrival accordingly. I like that check out is up to 12:00, an earlier time can be troublesome. There were two receptionists on duty and the queue cleared quickly. The Euston Travelodge only offers continental breakfast. Watch out for the times as it is quite late on weekends, 8:00. I arrived early, then again dead on time and the door was locked. When I was there only a few people were eating so the self service was fast and convenient. It was probably healthy for me too. The room was basic, which was what was expected. There was a double bed and somewhere to hang clothes, hospitality tray for tea and coffee, tv and desk. All adequate, clean and comfortable. The bedside lights were mobile and gave enough light. There was a good blind on the window, which faced onto other buildings not the busy streets. Euston station is 2-3 minutes away, less if the crossing lights are with you. The British Library is very close as are the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras and Kings Cross. Both Euston and Euston Square underground stations are close. There is a catholic church down the road. There is no restaurant but the area has several to pick from. This is a bed and breakfast hotel in an excellent location with no frills. I liked best the lack of fuss and the efficient nature of the service provided. Least good were the breakfast times, at weekends, and the number of pillows, but you can always ask for another pillow. This hotel is five stars because you get exactly what was advertised.",

        "content": "Stayed at the Travelodge Euston for 3 nights on a London break with wife and teenage daughter. There has been loads of reports on here about check in staff being dis-interested but the girl who checked us in was very polite & helpful. We had a room on the lower ground floor (basement basically) which had advantages and dis-advantages. The advantage was there was no traffic noise at all which many reiewers on T.A. complained of. The disadvantage was the window was sealed so therefore it became very stuffy, there was aircon which obviously wasn't working properly. The hotel location was great. Literally across the road from Euston Station which is only 4 stops from Leicester Square on the tube. Also, outside the station there are various eateries / coffee shops etc and a tip for the blokes - the Doric Arch pub in the station shows the Ashes on large LCD tellies which is where I sloped off to when the women were getting ready for the evening! There is a bar in the hotel which opened til around 11pm which was quite convenient. If anyone needs any info, please feel free to ask & I will glady answer as best I can.",

We booked 3 family rooms, which could have slept 3 people easily for an average of Â£40 per room. For such a central location this represents great value. The hotel is fairly new so still is clean and fresh, something that Travelodges sometimes fail on. It is situated right next to Euston station so is very handy. The area remains fairly noisy all night with plenty of street noise so this can lead to a broken nights sleep. If you are looking for budget accomodation in Central London then this is a really good bet.",

We had a quiet room although the windown did not open and has a horrible frosted screen over it to stop you being able to see out of it!

The hotel has plenty of free parking, a friendly, competent staff, the room was immaculate and nicely decorated, comfortable bed, on-site breakfast buffet (we were able to get a reduced price by asking when we checked in), free wireless internet. We definitely would recommend this hotel. As for \"be aware\" items - it is located very close to the airport, so we did occasionally hear a plane, but not to the point of it being a disturbance. Also the bathroom has a walk-in shower (no tub), which was fine for us. My over-6-ft-tall husband appreciated that the showerhead was mounted high up on the wall, so the water didn't hit him mid-chest (you tall people will know what I'm talking about!!).

The moment you arrive the property is clean, well lighted, and very clean. The front desk staff greets you & it is obvious that they have reviewed their guest reservations before I checked in. \"Colleen\" is just fantastic at the front. She knew all the info, explained every detail & was Nice. The room, hallways, gym & pool were spotless & made us feel secure from the germ world . The main focal point of this hotel is the lobby, bar, & restaurant area that is a central happy hour meeting place as well as the breakfast venue in the morning. The clientele are mostly business travelers & airline personnel. Given that information the regard from all the staff is that they are greeting you as a professional. Great Coffee, Great Evolution Bed and Plush clean smelling towels. It is really nice to get out of the pool or hot tub & have blue striped towels waiting for you. The bathroom products are Neutrogena & were very well stocked. The fitness room has a clean bathroom & Blue Crystal Water cold water dispenser with cups. The breakfast is run by the real kitchen with a real cook & wait staff. The beginning buffet is simply self serve with real fruit, juice, & the usual breakfast fare. We were impressed with the staff & the nighttime security in the parking lot. For convenience you park right up on the building and all is real close. It helps that the Hilton Homewood suites sister property is adjoining on the west side. We felt safe and relaxed usiung the pool area at night. we will definitely stay here again. Colleen & Brian make this place a service oriented great place to stay. thankyou & enjoy",

It is right next to another Hilton brand hotel Homewood Suites and whole property is semi gated and has plenty of free parking. Price of hotel breakfast is about twelve dollars but is well worth it. My children enjoyed heated, clean, spacious swimming pool. Location is what you might expect from a near airport hotel and the area reflects that. Which means nowhere scenic or serene.

The staff there was incredibly helpful and friendly (especially Aaron and Winnie). It is located between 5th and 6th Avenue and is incredibly convenient to a variety of great shops, stores and restaurants, including a Michelin one-starred place right next door. 24th is not a major cross street but we never had to wait more than 3 minutes for a cab plus you could walk to either 5th or 6th, in about 2 minutes time, if you wanted to catch a bus. We stayed on the 11th floor and did not hear any street noise - other guests, staying on lower floors, said the street noise was annoying - see if you can book a room higher up. Also, check with the front desk folks about getting vouchers for breakfast - the restaurant is a separate thing but they do a good job on omlettes and have a good variety of breakfast choices. We'll stay there again, gladly, when visiting Manhattan.",

We also got a great deal by getting reservations through the call center. So for the money and with no required fee for our 2 small dogs, we enjoyed our stay in the center of restaurants galore. The room was large enough with a satisfactory bathroom. The beds (double) were quite comfortable. The single king rooms may have a small refrigerator and microwave. Dorothy at the front desk was very friendly and took care of any questions and billing concerns very efficiently. There is a shuttle to the Galleria and areas within a 5 mile radius which is nice since you don't have to find a parking spot. The only negative is that the carpet wasn't very clean in our room and the shower curtain wouldn't hang right but since we had dogs, didn't complain about the carpet. I would stay here again.",

Overall we really enjoyed our time at the Resort the pools, restaurants, gardens etc are fantastic and for peak season there were plenty of sun lounges to go around. The resort had a mixture of families, couples and retirees staying there. We upgraded to the deluxe room with the outdoor shower plus club lounge benefits. The room was a bit older than I was expecting and could do with a bit of a makeover but it was very clean. The outdoor shower is a nice touch. The club lounge was great with free afternoon tea  softdrinks everyday  free alcohol from 5:30-7:30 every evening. You cannot fault the location of the Mandira its right on the beach and only a 15 minute walk into Kuta. The staff were extremely friendly and you could not fault their service. We ate dinner at the resort 3 times (in different restaurants) and the food was very nice. The breakfast is amazing with every type of food you can think of on offer. They also changed a few things every morning so there was some variety. My only complaint for the whole holiday was the bed in the room was extremely uncomfortable  we both ended up with very sore backs!!",

        "content": "Would NOT recommend Mandira A friend and I stayed at the Bali Mandira for a weeks holiday. The twin room needed refurbishing. The beds were very uncomfortable, you can not adequately block out the sunlight for a little sleep-in, we had to boil the kettle on the floor as this is where the powerpoint was, and to top it off when we asked for extra pillows we were told the hotel had ran out. Although I loved the rainshower they have in the bathroom.We had paid extra to have the club benefits, but I do not consider that this was worth it. The afternoon tea is not replenished, the cocktails are too sweet and poor quality alcohol - that is when a staff member is available to make them. Also none of the choices are rotated, so after a couple of days you would appreciate some variety.Only two internet terminals so a lot of waiting.Upper level pool had a nice view, but it was too hard to get any service up there. The ground level pool is small and you had to reserve a deck chair with a towel before you went to breakfast - which is ridiculous! The breakfast was very nice!!Nyepi Day (like a public holiday) was on when we were there - (take note - it is ILLEGAL to leave your hotel grounds on this day). The hotel served a buffet dinner and did not have enough seats so were turning guests away!!! Parents were begging for a plate to take back to their rooms for their families dinner as the were forbidden to leave the hotel!! Good location, but not worth the overall cost.",

        "content": "excellent bargain We stayed at the Bali Mandira two weeks prior to our wedding in Bali. We payed the extra 10 dollars for the upgrade to a deluxe cottage, and it was well worth it. The cottage itself was nothing special, not a lot of natural light came in, so it was quite dark and cold a lot of the time, however the bathroom was terrific! It was half enclosed, half open air, so you could stand in a little rockwalled shower, with tropical plants surrounding you and look up at the clear blue sky! Also included with the upgrade was access to the lounge area, which provided soft drinks and cakes free all day long, with a happy hour from around 5 to 7 with free cocktails - my husband was in heaven! The location is terrific - the beach is separated from the hotel by a pathway, however the beach itself was immaculate, a big change from the last time we stayed in Legian. Although you are only a short stroll from the main shopping streets, the hotel itself is very quiet. The two pools are fantastic, particularly the one on the roof top, and at nighttime, the candles on the tables that surround the other pool from the restaurant give it a really nice ambience. We were so happy with the Mandira, we will definitely stay there again.",

The room was comfortable. Beds nice and soft, slept well. The showers were wonderful, plenty of pressure and hot water. I was given two free bottles of water daily which is standard with the room. They provide food if you have Executive Lounge access from 6AM-10PM. Breakfast had a nice selection of cereals, fruits, breads...the only thing I didn't care for was the room temperature juice...They served mini sandwiches throughout the day which were great. They provided dinner later in the day, usually some local Mexican fare which was pretty good. The servers took the time to learn your name and what drinks you normally drink. I tried the buffet they had downstairs on Sunday. It was excellent. I tried the corn quesadilla and all it had in it was peppers and cheese, it was delish. They had pulled pork and shredded beef which was tender, juicy, and seasoned...No sauce was required. My only issue was when I had a friend come up to the room late one evening with me before heading to the clubs, security stopped us when getting on the elevator..and addressed my guest in Spanish like I wasn't standing there. I don't speak fluent Spanish and that was rude. I advised the front desk that is unacceptable. If you have an issue with my guest, you address me and not my guest. She was like for security issues, they needed the ID. Which is no big deal, I get that..but told her it's all about their presentation. But other than that little scene, the stay was great.",

        "content": "A review of the hotel will follow this WARNING: This hotel inflates the exchange rate on bookings made in USD which increases the cost of the nightly rate you will pay. This exchange rate inflation is not disclosed on Marriott.com and the estimated cost provided by Marriott.com understates the amount you will pay. Even more disgracefully, this practice is not disclosed on check-in. And what a shame since the hotel itself is rather nice. The front desk clerk told me Mexican hotels are legally able to inflate their exchange rates by up to 8%. Be sure to take this into account when comparing the Marriott Reforma against other options. Apart from the above, this hotel is rather lovely. Itâ€™s well located near the Independence Angel which means itâ€™s roughly halfway between the downtown Zocalo area and the Bosque de Chapultapec / Polanco area. The room is standard Marriott fare; comfortable and well appointed. Maid service was spotless and prompt. I did find the wireless signal to be very weak in the room, but thereâ€™s a strong signal in the lobby and the executive lounge. The standout feature is the executive lounge which has a spectacular outdoor balcony overlooking Paseo de la Reforma. The staff annoyingly require a signature even on a zero dollar invoice which smacks of fishing for tips, but apart from that the staff are very helpful and friendly and the food and drink options are very good. Overall a lovely hotel, but the experience was marred by the hotelâ€™s distasteful practice of inflating the exchange rate which is really a cash grab designed to make you pay more than anticipated for the room. What a shame.",

        "content": "We stayed at the Pacific Terrace Hotel for 5 nights October 11-15. We traveled with our 2 1/2 year old and all had a wonderful time. The best part of this hotel is the location right on the beach. The location is also great for visiting other attractions - we were a half hour from Legoland in Carlsbad (a must do if you have kids) and only a 15 minute drive downtown, to the zoo and Coronado. La Jolla was only 10 minutes away. Second best are the rooms - just gorgeous and very comfortable. The plasma TV was a nice luxury. The neighborhood around the hotel (Pacific Beach) caters to 20 somethings with lots of surf shops, bars, restaurants and boutiques. It wasn't our scene but we felt safe to walk around and enjoyed eating at the various restaurants. The Broken Yolk for breakfast was great. The hotel's continental breakfast is nice, but simple. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. All in all, this is a great hotel and we will definitely be back again. To whomever gave me the referral for Amanda Prince photography - thank you! Our family pictures on the beach turned out beautifully. My only disappointment was the weather. It was cloudy, cold, windy and rainy for 3 out of the 5 days we were there.",

We very brought free soft drinks round the pool, breakfast is included in the price as are cookies at 4pm and wine which is served between 4-5pm. If you are too relaxed to get off your poolside lounger then the wine is brought to you! It wasn't the cheapest of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our tour of California and Las Vegas but it was the most relaxing and worth every penny! I was a bit worried about the location having read previous reviews but saw less homeless people hanging aroung this hotel than we did in the others we stayed in. The cost of parking our hire car in the secure underground garage was comparable or less than other hotels. Our teenagers also felt welcome and relaxed here. We couldn't fault this hotel in any way and will always remember our time here.",

From the moment we stepped into the foyer, there were nothing but smiles and helpful staff. Even though there was some renovation going on, they were courteous and very dilligent regarding warning us about areas that were unsafe. We were upgraded to a beautiful room on the 3rd floor, great breakfast, gorgeous views of the morning sunrise, surfers, and dolphins frolicking. The pool was very clean and large enough for everyone to enjoy, especially with the complimentary wine service! How can you put a price on someone bringing you free wine while you watch the kids play in the pool , it's fun to watch all people walking by on the boardwalk....it's so easy to stay here that it's not fair to have a vacation like that and hold all others to it's standard. We rented a car, went to SeaWorld and the Zoo, spent the rest of the days by the pool & the beach. I can't wait to stay here again!",

        "content": "Blooms. Essex. UK. Visited April 2007 We booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and some travel books. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Our ocean view room was hugely expensive at $400 but because of the price and reviews we were expecting something luxurious. It certainly wasn't. The view was great but the room and the hotel was very tired and needs updating. Our room was musty and the bathroom was tiny with the shower being something from the 70's. We had previously stayed in Las Vegas at $100 per night in a room bigger and better. The breakfast was fine but what a small and dingy room. The fitness centre was a joke. Not big enough to swing a cat in. Outside of the hotel is a toilet block so don't have a room on the left of the hotel as you will look out over it and the surrounding area is full of wooden shacks with quite a few homeless and young people partying. The staff were very pleasant but our stay was ruined as we felt the room was only worth max. $200. If you go here do not spend any more. I can't stress enough how it didn't meet our expectations. In fact we left early as we were so disappointed.",

The staff was so friendly and helpful. The breakfast was okay but nothing fantastic. We were able to use the free parking every night. Sometimes we would have to park by the boardwalk and then wait until about 9 or 10pm and then park in the free spots. The boardwalk parking is free but you will be towed or ticketed after midnight because of the street cleaners. The beach is right outside the gate of the hotel. We enjoyed watching the surfers early in the morning and staying up late and watching the waves crash the beach. The gift shop is reasonable and has many gifts available to take home to remember your trip. Again, you will not be disappointed in your visit to the Pacific Terrace Hotel.",

I wanted a nice place to bring my 8-year old son while we toured the zoo, LegoLand, and SeaWorld. I was not disappointed. The hotel was clean, well maintained, and modernized. The staff all were friendly, helpful, and never far away. I was amazed at the number of staff available to help the guests. I selected the least expensive room based on the rates quoted on the phone. I then booked the room online and got an even better rate. The \"garden view\" room I requested (rather than the more expensive \"ocean view\" room) still had a view of the ocean from the litte patio we had. And I could hear the waves from my room. I was pleased with the amenities we had in our room: free wireless internet, fridge, coffe pot, and mini-bar, 2 sinks, very handicap accessible bathroom, patio and chairs outside by a little garden area, 2 very comfortable queen beds, a desk and chair plus a little table and more chairs. We were very happy. While there was no restaurant onsite, we liked the free continental breakfast in the morning. We had lots to eat there. Plus there were drinks available there all day for free. Snacks and drinks were available by the heated outdoor pool. From 4-5 pm was a free wine hour. There were tons of restaurants nearby to chose from after our busy day. The location right on the boardwalk of the beach was great. It was quiet at night, and busy during the day. The area felt very safe to me (a single mom with her young son). This is a great choice for either a couple getting away or a family seeing the San Diego sights.",

The Continental breakfast was a hit with the kids & the cinnamon buns were yummy. We ordered \"room service\" one evening & the food was room temp when it arrived & both kid's meals were incorrect - we ordered chicken tenders & fries and grilled cheese & fries & got 2 hamburgers (whatever). We were told a crib would be in our room upon checking in, we had to ask for the crib to be delivered. Hmmm.... all in all- if we went again, we would rent a house instead of staying in a hotel - this or any other for that matter. A week is just too long in a hotel room with 2 kids - even if it is a 2 room suite. The room service was funny too - we came in two times while the turn down service was being performed & the maids were JAMMING to some \"Mexican\" tunes on the clock radio. They were nice & the room was always very clean, but it was pretty funnny.",

Hey management, FIX the lock!!! it is the major complaint everyone is talking about at the pool. seems it happens to everyone 2. again the lock on the door to the boardwalk. it wont close unless you push it shut. was open almost everytime I went in or out. lessens my sense of security especially since my young family was staying on the ground level 3. the room prices. Made my res directly with the hotel and they matched the best rate I could find on the net. 199 plus 22 tax plus 15 parking. when I was checking in, 2 walk ups were quoted 60 dollars cheaper a night. I know supply and demand, but I was a little put off. Overall, a good hotel and a great location.

        "content": "We are a family of four who stayed at the Pacific Terrace for 3 nights. I cannot believe that other posts do not list the overriding fact that the area of Pacific Beach is a complete dump and not family friendly. It is a mix of collge nightclubs, run down motels, surf dives, and delapidated shops. The crowd is college party drinkers, homeless, and way-way out of towners (foreign/Michigan). Our guest's car was broken into the second night and the hotel would net help offset the costs of fixing the smashed window, they did not even check on us for the rest of our stay. The room was late in being ready at check-in, the concierge was completely wrong about availability of road bikes at their rental outlets, the hotel restaurant recommendations are the ones that are closest, and the whole thing has the feel of a motel with an expensive facelift. The price ($350/night) for a premium view room makes it seem as if the area, facilities, services will be high-end--this is not at all the case. BTW, the beach is across from the hotel but you have to go down a 30-foot bluff to get there--just don't get hit by a bike or trip over a homeless guy to get there.",

First of all, for location, it's tough to beat. Pacific Beach is a great area to visit, with excellent restaurants, a number of good bars, and a beautiful beach. Having said this, the area is lacking in nice hotels. The Pacific Terrace was fantastic. We booked a \"Garden View\" room online for a discounted rate, but when we arrived we upgraded to an ocean view mini-suite because the hotel was not full. The view was perfect, and if possible I would encourage the ocean view rooms, as the \"garden\" appeared to actually be an alley. The room was clean, staff excellent, pool and hot tub area very nice, the breakfast was good, plentiful, and fresh, and there was plenty of parking below the hotel. We will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel.",

It is a few block from the main highway, but not right on top of it. So you can easily get to downtown or the beach without any trouble. It is within walking distance to all the hospitals and offices. There is a fabulous dining and shopping district right across the street. Pretty much anything you are in the mood for you can get within a 5 minute walk. Being a fairly young female and traveling alone, I am always careful of my surroundings. I felt safe walking around at night and being in the hotel alone. The hotel itself is nice. It is a simple hotel, nothing really fancy about it. But it is comfortable and clean. The rooms are very large! And comes with a full kitchen complete with a closet full of kitchen utensils and supplies. While my room only had a king, I felt as though with the right beds, you could comfortably sleep 4-5 people easily. The bathroom was nice and clean with a good amount of counter space. The hotel has a pool and hottub. I did not get the chance to go in, but I walked around it and saw people in there enjoying it. It has a good amount of parking underneath the hotel. The hotel served a wonderful breakfast with freshly made waffles, eggs, cereal, etc. The hotel staff was so wonderful and friendly. They were quick to help me when I got locked out of my room and had great recommendations for food and fun local places. If you are looking for a nice hotel around the hospitals and even a little out of downtown but still close to everything, this is a great hotel. It is reasonable priced, has great features, and can really accommodate anyone.",

        "content": "My husband an I arrived at the hotel on Sunday, September fourth about 1 hour before check in. We parked in one of the 2 spaces they have out front. I went in to let them know we were here understanding that a room would probably not be ready. When I entered the small lobby and walked up to the desk the young lady behind the desk did not even say hi nothing she just looked up at me. I informed her of our stay and she told me there were no rooms ready. I said okay and asked about having our car parked and if we needed to access the car during our stay could we. She could not tell me where they parked the car and said they could only get it for us and it would take 15 to 20 minutes to get the car. We took our luggage out of the car and John (the only nice person) took our car to the unknown lot. We thought we would just wait in the lobby till our room was ready. After waiting only a few minutes Matt the manager called us to the desk to let us know a room was ready. We went to the room which had a maintenance man fixing a light fixture in the bathroom and a drilling noise that made the walls shake. I went back to the lobby to ask about a room without drilling and possibly not a maintenance man. The same young lady, Julia, was at the desk and told me there were no rooms without the drilling available for our stay. I asked to speak to Matt the manager. She told me to go back to the room and he would call. A few minutes later Matt called and said there were no rooms that did not have the drilling and not to worry as it only goes from 10 am to 5 pm. I told him we would leave then and he said fine to go ahead and leave as he could not help us. There were no apologies and no attempts to solve the problem.No I am sorry let's try and work this out. He just told us to leave. We gathered all our stuff, went downstairs and I told them how unhappy I was and that the room was not ready that there was someone in the room fixing a light. He could not have cared less and we left. We went a few blocks down the street to the Inter Continental Hotel and we were in a bigger, beautiful and cheaper room in 15 minutes. This was a birthday getaway for my husband and I which I mentioned at the Griffon and got no response. The Inter Continental sent up a lovely pastry selection with Happy Birthday wishes! What a difference in customer service and quality.",

        "content": "My favorite type of hotel is the kind that makes you feel like you're staying in an incredible home, without any traces of those standard, cookie cutter rooms that are a dime a dozen. I prefer something that offers a distinct personality but also a calming sense of familiarity. That said, I hereby declare that the Hotel Andra in Seattle is the Tina Fey of the hospitality industry - alluring and cool and quirky and fun, all rolled into one. It's a rare find that offers exceptional design, ample space, distinct character, and stellar customer service. I came across the Andra via my secret weapon, aka my friend Steve who just happens to work for the Seattle Convention and Visitor's Bureau. With a prime location in the heart of Seattle's Belltown area and moderate price range (under $200/night), I knew we were off to a good start, and after poking around their website, the vibe and decor seemed like the right match too. I was instantly drawn in by the sleek lighting, clean lines, and tasteful color palette of muted blues, greys, and taupes, with touches of Scandanvian inspiration. The Andra was our last stop during our recent honeymoon vacation, and prior to checking in, I had just made my detour to Cupcake Royale. So as I approached the reception desk with a box of treats in hand, in lieu of the standard welcome, the person behind the counter launched into a bit about how nice it was for me to bring him cupcakes. I played right along - I love it when people loosen up and goof around like that, especially people who work in the higher end of the hospitality world, where more often than not you'll encounter some pretty stiff attitudes. The front desk staff seemed to think they were in a improv group, with me as their special guest star, so score one for the Andra. Score two was finding out upon check in that we'd been upgraded to a suite (thanks to the little Upgrade Fairy, also known as my friend Steve who had put in a call to the manager). Also, the timing couldn't have been better in terms of being granted additional space - we'd accumulated a lot of goodies over the past week, and found ourselves in a serious repacking situation, which meant needing some room to spread out. Wish granted: a corner suite with a spacious living room area that included a flatscreen TV, giant desk, and full length mirror, along with another flatscreen TV in the separate bedroom. The bathroom was also really cute and stylish, and the stash of Face Stockholm products made me a very happy girl. The Andra proved to be the perfect end to our trip - so if you're headed to Seattle, this is the place to stay.",

The bed was very comfortable, and the plasma TV screen and furnishings were modern and stylish. The staff were courteous and helpful at all times. My only criticism was the room service from the Lola restaurant. Not only did they deliver the wrong order, but it was over-salted and over-priced. They did however give me a full refund without quibbling when I complained. The hotel is in a very central location, and I would definitel recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in downtown Seattle.",

We didn't interact much with the staff, but when we did, they were fine. We had no problems at all, and found the lobby and room decor to be pretty cool. On arriving, we found our room had a view of a building immediately adjacent. We asked for another room and were accomodated. We did not find the hotel overly noisy (although we were out pretty late ourselves). While we didn't really put the Andra to the test, we were satisfied with our experience and the value received for what we paid.",

It is in a perfect location near all of the great areas. We walked everywhere. There are awesome restuarants right nearby in the up and coming, funky neighborhood of Belletown, like - FlyingFish (HIGHY recommend), Toi, great Thai, Mama Mexico, Assagio (next to the hotel). I absolutely LOVED Seattle, loved the location of this hotel and would absolutely stay there again. The beds were the most comfortable and luxurious I have slept on outside of the W. The rooms are funky, the people are so nice and friendly and helpful. The rooms remind me of a room at a Spa - very calming and serene. The lobby is cool and trendy, yet cozy. The bar is great... The area is perfect - great for walking east to the VERY COOL area of Capital hill, or to the dowtown water front, it is also right near the shopping district and very close to the Space Needle... it's all you could ever want.....",

The hotel does not have some of the amenities as other luxury hotels (in-house spa, pool), but it has a lot of character in the style of the old luxury hotels, like the Drake in Chicago. Unlike some of the other reviews for this hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful (maybe the Management responded to the negative feedback). My only complaints were: the street noise during weekday commute hours (windows need better insulation) and both of our room keys kept demagnetizing. Otherwise, the Suite was very spacious and comfortable. In fact, I have never slept in a more comfortable and cozy bed. Bathroom is small, but cute and Art Deco-like. The decor in general is very new and Ikea inspired. Valet parking was quick, efficient and friendly (always asked if we needed directions). I highly recommend Lola's (located in the lobby) for breakfast and a nightcap. There was absolutely NO onion smell. I definitely would stay here again.",

The room was quite small, but the bathroom was a good size. There is no dresser in the room. I also found it odd to have the coffee machine in the bathroom, which doesn't seem very sanitary. The hallways are dark and dreary and look like they need a good cleaning. Our son lives in Seattle and we were going to drive his car back to the hotel in the evenings and park it there, only to find out there was an outragious fee to park there. They don't let the guests park there for free even though they have a huge parking lot. The one good thing about the Edgewater is that they have a very friendly and professional staff.

My son accidentally left his $400 glasses bedside.. Easy enough to get back just hours after realizing his mistake right? WRONG!! The staff was less than helpful and \"claimed\" they looked for them but to no avail. They were rude and impatient. Best hotel in seattle?? Who and how much did they pay to say that? STAY ELSEWHERE! Waste of money and valuable time.",

The Beatles, Roy Orbison, $@!#% Jagger & the Stones as well as anybody who was anybody in those days stayed at this great hotel. You used to be able to fish from your rooms in those days. The hotel sits out over the water...the only one like this...in Puget Sound. You just can't get any closer. If you fell out your window, you'd be in the water. There is a great bar and restaurant, beautifully designed, and part of the bar edges around the restaurant, outside. Food is great too. Rooms are not very fancy, nor big, but have so much 'woodsy' character and such terrific views, that the place is hard to beat. Within walking distance along Alaskan way to all the waterfront restaurants. Just next door to the Victoria ferry terminal, and on the otherside, there's a cruise ship dock. Up a few blocks is the main shopping center for Seattle's downtown area, and the monorail which goes to the Seattle Space needle. Cannot say enough about this wonderful Hotel and its perfect location. Oh yes, and on Thursday evenings, the Seattle Yacht Club has its sailing races and the boats get so close to the rooms and the main lobby and restaurant that you can see the faces on the sailors. Just phenomenal!",

I only had two issues, but it didn't take away from the wonderful time we had there. You have to have valet parking regardless of the fact that you may not be leaving the room or grounds. The valet parking is an extra 34$ on top of the nightly rate. They used to have where you could park right in front on your own, but they changed that. We had a beautiful, king, water view room one of the windows had bird droppings all over it. It was a great stay!!! We plan on coming back at least 4 times a year. It was wonderful Thank you Edgewater for going above and beyond on customer service!!! ps Room service food was amazing!!",

When we arrived to Edgewater we were a little worried with the decore. VERY rustic, strange fake trees every where in the lobby. Kind of dark? We received our room key and proceeded down a long creepy dingy, smelly,narrow hallway to our room. We were shocked to find out that we didn't have a water view! The room was so small there was barely room for a bed! Immediately I called the front desk I was told that they were out of waterview rooms. We were given an option of a room with 2 beds. The new room was normal in size. Nothing exciting. Needless to say totally disappointing. Will not be back and we are not recommending to family and friends. We had stayed 2 days prior at The Hyatt Place near the space needle. Now that's Awesome hotel! Book a room at the Hyatt and you wont be disappointed!!",

It makes for a very cozy, comfortable feeling. The rooms have luxurious beds, large stone showers, leather chairs and footrests before the fireplace and all the amenities. Our balcony, right above Elliott Bay, was the perfect location to view the waterfront and see Mt. Rainier, when the weather was clear. Being right next to the pier for the cruise ships to Alaska and the ferries to Victoria and the San Juan Islands make its location ideal for these trips and walking distance to almost all the attractions. The hotel also provides a shuttle service within a two-mile radius. There is a gourmet restaurant and lively adjoining lounge, as well as a cozy large lobby with floor to ceilling windows looking out on the water. All in all a very relaxing and enjoyable stay, and we will return here when next we visit Seattle.",

        "content": "If I could give this hotel a 4.5, I would have. There are only a few little flaws in the hotel that deducted a few points. Stayed in Seattle the first weekend in November and chose The Edgewater due to its proximics to most of the major attractions in the city. We were without a car and are walkers so this was a plus. If you are not the hotel offers a free shuttle that runs every hour and will take you anywhere withing two miles. We only took the shuttle once and realized they don't pick you up (not a problem in our case) but...if they do they never mentioned it!! The hotel is older and at first glance may not be up to everyones perfection but it is well kept and does actually sit out over the water. It's next to the cruise line building, near the Aquarium, the wharf, and ferry buildings. Not to mention Pike Market and some amazing restaurants. The hotel offers wonderful views from the sitting area which comes complete with fireplace and from the lounge as well. Our room was a water front room and the views were wonderful to awake to. Our room was of decent size with comfortable bed, warm gas fireplace. docking station for and iPod and big bathroom. That bathroom was one of our low points. Our photos showed a soaking tub and I requested one when I called to confirm. I did not receive one, rather a very nice walk in shower. I was really looking forward to the soaking tub as we were staying there for three nights! Another disappointment was the cost of INTERNET. In this day and age I really do expect free Internet?! Most of our better hotels do offer it! Our room was right near the railway so we had a constant rumble. If this is going to bother you, ask for a room closer to the main of the building. I don't know how the rooms on the upper levels might fare with the sounds. Everyone at the hotel was very pleasant. Room service was fast and efficient. The food was very good as well. The one thing I would advise is if you ask for a cab; don't let them tell you to come down and let them call. You will sit for twenty minutes. Tell the front door man you will be down for a cab in ten! It's a $32 cab ride to the airport or a $40 town car ride. So if you are a tipper ~ you do the math?! It was clean, comfy, good food, good views...and a walk to everywhere! Enjoy. I'd go back in a heart beat!",

It also provided a close location for the Opera we were attending that night for my wife birthday Our arrival was met with friendly valet and check-in staff. Upon arrival they notified me I had be complimentary upgraded to the Beatles Suite -- now, mind you, I didn't even know what they were talking about. When they told me the history I thought, \"huh, this should be pretty cool.\" Man. It was AWESOME. The room is HUGE. Decked out in Red and White and wooden decor. Little did I know my wife's affinity for British style and the Beatles. Having the Beatles pictures, books and memorabilia made the stay totally unreal. Icing on the cake - a CD with all their hits to listen to as we lounges in the spacious room. The room was immaculate (and my wife is very meticulous) comfortable and cozy with a shower and a large bear-claw tub (ah-yeah). The restaurant was great - a spectacular view of the sunset, great service and delicious food. At night, I stopped in for a bit and it was a lively and fun atmosphere. My only regret is that with our planned night out, we didn't have time to enjoy the room and hotel as much as we could have. The next time, the hotel will be the destination. Period. We had a great time and really did not want to leave.",

        "content": "My husband and I stayed at the Edgewater for 4 nights in a city view room that was located on the the 3rd floor. We travel a lot and typically stay in upscale hotels. First, I would like to say that the staff here were very friendly and the housekeeping did an exceptional job of keeping the room clean each night. The hotel itself is an older hotel and I would not consider it an upscale hotel but we still had a pleasant stay. The room itself was small and cozy with a great fireplace. The bathroom on the other hand was great & would definitely hold up in a 4 star hotel. The room itself I would give a 3-star rating. The TVs were not LCD/flat screen and you could see the age of the room. The pillows and the bed were not comfortable for us. The train did keep my husband up at night. I took sleeping pills so I slept through the train. We did not like the fact that you had to pay for internet but this did not take away from our stay b/c there were coffee shops in the area that did offer free wi-fi. The cool part about this hotel was it was over the water. We did enjoy our stay but I am not sure if it would have been so great if we had paid full price on it. We bid on it using Priceline so that is probably why I title it \"a pleasant stay at the Edgewater\". I think if we would have paid full price we would have been disappointed. I would stay here again but not if I had to pay full price....so sorry Edgewater! We do thank u all for being so nice to us during our stay!!",

        "content": "We just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had a great experience. The property is very nice and the location is unbeatable for the Ka'anapali area. The hotel is located on a great stretch of Ka'anapali Beach right on Black Rock which offers beautiful snorkeling/scuba diving right in front of the hotel. It is also less than a 5 minute walk to Whaler's Village shopping and dining center which is also very convenient. The hotel is well kept and the rooms are not fancy but are updated and quite comfortable. Every evening the cliff jumpers light torches on black rock and jump off into the water. Its nothing crazy but a nice little touch that makes you feel connected to a forgotten true Hawaiian spirit. Our room upon check-in was the last room along Black Rock and had a great view but awkward layout. The cable didn't work and they couldn't fix it so they moved us to a new room in which they upgraded us to a Jr. Suite. The room was huge and was really nice. The staff did a great job to make up for the inconvenience and we were very happy with their assistance. I am a Starwood Platinum member so that may have helped out with getting a room upgrade but it was very nice of them to offer an upgrade without me having to ask for it. Sometimes the large resorts do not recognize Platinum status as much as more business-travel oriented hotels but this resort was very accommodating. The only negative, and this is really picking here, is that the pool is kind of an awkward layout. It is quite narrow in places and feels a bit small despite its enormous length from end-to-end. There is plenty of room on the other side for a second pool and it would be nice to see even a smaller, adults only pool as main pool area can seem a bit crowded and overrun with energetic kids. Overall I would highly recommend this property for those looking for a true mega-resort feel in the heart of Ka'anapali. The property has tons of energy and really is a great location. The hotel is great for families with children both older and younger as there is no shortage of activities. It is also great for those who like the feel of being in a larger resort town as it is merely minutes away from Lahaina and there are tons of activities, shops, and restaurants in the area. For those looking for a quieter, romantic getaway I would say that this resort is not exactly geared towards you. I would have no problem returning to this hotel when I have kids.",

The room was really small and was desperately in need of a refurb. It just felt really tatty and dirty and we didn’t really like spending too much time there. This was the general impression that we got from the hotel, it all looks a bit tired and when you compare it to some of the other newer resorts it really fails into insignificance. On the plus side though we did get a really cheap deal with Expedia for this hotel so we didn’t waste loads of money on it. There is also so much to do in Vegas that if you’re looking for somewhere just to sleep that is cheap then Harrah’s is an ok choice. The location is also really good as it’s right on the central strip, but with hindsight I would definitely prefer to pay a bit more and get a better standard of accommodation, particularly given how much choice there is in Vegas.",

If you were 4 floors above that or more - the view of the strip was nice (my mother in law was in that room). Anyway - the computers were broken when we checked in, so we got what we got & were allowed to change it - but it would've taken FOREVER since it took so long to check-in with the paper route. Each desk clerk had a thick stack of paper listing each room & would check off each room as they booked it. The computers were working later as our trip progressed but there was no point in changing rooms at that time because we had already unloaded all our stuff in the room with no view. Either way - hotel was nice, room was fine, casino (as they all usually are) was SMOKY! Food in the one restaurant where we ate breakfast every morning b/c we were being lazy in looking for other choices was great. Inexpensive, good food and in our hotel, which was great. All in all - it was a good trip. but as I have mentioned in another review for another strip hotel - I would stay more centrally located - like at Paris or Bellagio, if you can afford it. it is such a huge place and just much easier to be close to everything!",

        "content": "Stayed at Harrah's Feb 15-16th with my sister. Check-in seemed to go fine, we parked our car in their garage, hauled all our luggage up to our room and... the key card wouldn't work! Very annoyed we kept trying but had no luck. I walked down the hall towards the elevator and was getting ready to call the front desk when a bell boy came down the hall. I told him we had just checked in and our card wasn't working. He said 'aw man, I hope it's not the battery' checked our paperwork that showed the room we were in, used his card to let us in and told us to just let the front desk know our cards weren't working, they must not of been activated properly. So we proceded to get ourselves all settled in, unpacked some of our toiletries, used the restroom, and hung out for awhile looking at brochures and relaxing. We were in there probably 30 mins and decided it was time to 'hit the strip'. But first we need to stop by the desk and get our cards activated, no big deal right? WRONG!!! We told the man at the desk the situation and that our key wouldn't work and he asked to see my paperwork and ID which I gave to him, and he asked if the room was in my name and I said yes. He then took out this little purple strip of paper that was in the folder with the room key and asked if we knew the womans name that was on it. We said no and we had no idea what that paper was even for and I thought the womans name on it was the lady that checked me in. He explained that no it should of been my name on it and it was very strange but somehow when I checked in I was handed the wrong paper. That was why our key wouldn't work is because we were going to the wrong room. We explained that we went to the room we were told to go to and how were we to know any different! After asking us if we had been in the room long and if we had touched much and we said yes we had laid on the beds and used the restroom, he still made us move to a different room! He said he was sorry but the room we went to was registered to the lady who's name was on the paperwork and we were supposed to be in room xxx so we were going to have to move! Not only that but because it was a 'security issue' security would have to open the room for us and we had to identify our luggage before we could get it. So he called security and told them to meet us up there, gave us corrct paperwork, apologized again, etc. We hurried back up to our original room assuming security would already be there, but no one was in sight. By now our patience was extremely thin and I found it inexcuseable to have to wait for security, I picked up the house phone in the hall and angrily explained the situation and was put on hold, then security finally decided to saunter on up so I hung up. Security proceeded to watch our every move while we gathered our belongings making us feel practically like criminals. The one guy thought it was very weird we had to move to another room and told us to talk to the manager cause it wasn't right how we were treated. We agreed so we did stop by the managers desk where he apologized and comped our first night's stay. Now all that would of been good and fine if the rest of our stay had gone well, the one night free did go a long way towards making up for all our aggravation although it still stunk to start our night off with such a bad start. However we continued to have a bad experience at this hotel! The first morning there we had just got up and my sister was taking a shower when suddenly this very loud, obnoxious alarm goes off. I called the front desk and told them there was this hideous alarm going off and she asked if we were smoking and I said no and she said she'd look into it. Then we opened the door and there was a maid in the room across from us and she said everything is fine it's nothing to worry about. Ok well that's good to know, however it still took them a good 10 minutes to turn the blasted thing off, it was horrible! Later that day we came back to our room in the afternoon to relax for a little while and I went to get some ice to drink ice water and their ice machine was broken! It may seem like a minor thing but it was just one more irritation. Then to top it all off you would expect after such a bad stay to at least get good cutoomer service while checking out, but oh no not at Harrah's! I was all prepared to compain about everything that went wrong but when the woman checking us out asked how our stay was and I replied 'not very good' she just said 'oh, not very good huh'. I couldn't believe it! A normal response would of been oh I'm so sorry what was the problem? not 'oh not very good'! Then when I got my receipt I couldn't tell what had been charged to my card so I said 'can I get a total on here' and she snapped at me 'it's right there plain as day!' Well no, it was not! It had a charge with a minus sign, a room charge, the buffet we ate at Rio and then another charge with a minus sign. At the bottom where it said total it said zero. There was no total on the bill! I wanted to make darn sure the bill was correct and our one night had been comped so I went over to the manager again but he was busy with another customer. So finally another guy asked if he could help us and he explained our bill but when I said the lady checking us out had been rude he didn't respond so we just got the heck out of there! I honestly have never had such a bad experience at a hotel in my life and even if I was offered a free stay there I would hesitate to return!",

The 'select' rooms are wonderful, really comfortable, spotlessly clean and at under $40 a night Including resort fee, is well worth the money. Cassandra Blackwell who is a hotel supervisor is wonderful. I have contacted her numerous times with questions and she always writes back to you quick, thanks for all your help Cassandra! Also at check in we were dealt with by Lisbertha, what a really nice person, thank you! We ate in Roxys and at the buffet in the hotel, really enjoyed both as usual !! Location is not an issue for us, after an evening down the really busy strip, people everywhere and getting pestered by people trying to force these cards in your hand we find it so relaxing to get out of that environment back to a nice relaxing atmosphere and comfortable hotel. Cant wait to visit again!",

The rooms were beautiful, clean and spacious. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were nice and clean as well. The distance from the main part of the strip is not that bad at all and we walked it nearly everyday and night and did not feel uncomfortable one bit. The deuce bus stop is right by the side of the building so again no problems with transport.. We had pre paid our trip through Expedia so we didn't have to worry about hidden charges like other people are complaining about.. Only disappointment was no free WiFi in the room however i didn't have a problem walking down the road to McDonald's and using their free WiFi.. All in all i had a great hotel experience and would definitely stay in the select rooms again.",

I'm a bit cynical about the whole Vegas thing and this was just a one-night stop on our tour of the West. I'm afraid I left still cynical. But the hotel is ok, has good facilities, cheap rooms, free parking, free entry to the tower. Really can't complain too much. Tower was the best thing about Vegas in my view so well worth sitting up there with a drink. Location not perfect but it's not difficult to get to the main strip. Had to queue for check-in and check-out which I found very frustrating. Only place on our tour that didn't do free wi-fi.",

        "content": "Our family of 8 people, including a 4 month old, was really looking forward to a nice relaxing vacation at the Biltmore over the Memorial Day weekend. As an added bonus, we got a great rate ($100/night including the resort fee!) for three rooms. That's where the excitement stopped. We had problems getting what we asked for (we are talking simple things like towels and ice), the pool was packed and ridiculously expensive with terrible service and rude people, and parking was awful. Check in was easy, however, with a baby, I needed a crib and a microwave brought to our room. When we got to our room, it was the furthest set of buildings in the hotel and a little worn out – could use some updating. I was told to use the refrigerator in the room, I’d have to empty the mini bar. When I went to empty it half of the bottles were open and half drank and never replaced. Gross --- not to mention I’m sure an extra charge to me. The crib came within an hour of check in without a hitch, but the microwave was a $25 charge, took 5 phone calls to get, and interrupted our baby's sleep by finally getting it at 9:15pm (11:15pm our local time) after we had been told they were out and we wouldn’t get one until the next day and were already in bed. To get ice in this hotel, you need to call food service, who then brings you a little container. You can’t take your ice bucket to get it yourself. When we asked the person who came if we could get more, he told us the first floor maid area had some if we wanted to go there to get it – of course this was after we had to tip the guy. In my parents’ room next door, they had the smoke detector going off in the middle of the night because of a dead battery. They called to get it fixed—the front desk sent an “engineer” who pulled the smoke detector off the wall and left the cord hanging. It was fixed two days after it was reported. We spent Saturday and half of Sunday at the Paradise pool. Our group is all early risers, so getting a chair wasn’t a problem, although it was for many around us. Our problem was they don’t start serving food at the pool until 11:30, and when they do, a cheeseburger is $18. A few people in our group ran to Safeway and brought back donuts for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. We were a big group, so it would have been expensive to eat there. Upon bringing the donuts down to the pool, we were told that they served food in this area so carry-ins weren’t allowed. At 8:30 in the morning the line at the coffee shop was out the door and around the corner and the pool grill didn’t open for another 3 hours – give me a break, not to mention that it wasn’t posted anywhere because we looked. Our family is usually a pretty “go with the flow” kind of family, who gets along with anyone and doesn’t say much, which is why I felt compelled to write this review when we all felt strongly about our stay. The grounds are very pretty (which you see on your 20 minute walk from the parking garage), but we felt nickel and dimed the entire stay, the rooms could use updating, and the level of service we received was barely par level and certainly not what I was expecting from a place with the reputation of the Biltmore.",

All of the staff that we encountered were super friendly and accomodating and we met some really great locals and guests while sitting around the fire pits. As per previous negative reviews, the food and drinks are pretty expensive, but there are plenty of off property options to take advantage of.

OK the rooms are not large but we were told that before we booked. They are kept beautifully clean and the beds are to die for.The best nights sleep that we had for the whole holiday. The location and proximity to Union Square is an added bonus as is the Cablecar stop right outside of the hotel. The hotel bar did close a bit early for our liking, but the complimentary bottle of wine in the room made up for it.However, we found a fantastic Bar just down the road on the right hand side which I can recommend. It is straight out of the 30`s , I think it is called the Golden Lounge. The little present for the ladies was a very nice touch, the chocolates had bloomed a bit but were very palatable. Breakfast was excellent in both quantity and quality as was the seemingly permanent availability of some of the best coffee I have tasted. Service could not be faulted, if anything a bit too attentive but nice all the same. In all I can honestly recommend this Hotel for a stay in S.F. and I would have no hesitation in re-booking when and if we return.",

        "content": "If you want to shop in SF, look no further. Hotel is on Union Square. Hotel is exactly what I was looking for. I like staying in five star hotels just like anyone would, and this hotel is not a five star hotel. But, if you are generally an easy going, non high strung person not irritated that something is not 'perfect' and brand new- this is a great hotel on Powell St. where the cable cars run and close to everything we wanted to do. Room is smallish but so what- all I did was sleep there. How much room beside the bed do you need? Bathroom has a shower, sink, and toilet. They all were clean and functioning. What else do you need? Breakfast was convenient and tasty. Bottom line: if you don't need a five star hotel in SF then you don't have to pay for one and can still have a great room at a great price (with add-on parking I would suggest). Loved the uniqueness and boutique feel. Keep doing what your doing Chancellor. I'll be back!",

        "content": "My Wife and I plus our 3 adult sons (24-32) spent two days at this Hotel in mid May this year. We were given adjoining rooms on the 12th floor overlooking Powell Street and the famous cable car line. The rooms were well furnished and clean but with no coffee or tea making facilities, these were downstairs in the reception area and meant a bit of a hike if we wanted coffee in the room. The fact that the rooms were adjoining ment we could circulate between them without having to go out in to the hallway though. The Hotel provided a rollaway bed for one of our sons which made their room a bit of a squeeze and we were told that they were phasing them out but it meant not having to pay for a third room for the 5 of us. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful and the reception area had nice settees with a large bowl of fruit and a breakfast bar beyond which we did not use. We had picked up a hire car from the airport and used the multistory car park in Sutter Street which the Hotel has an overnight arrangement with. Be careful though, the car park is a little difficult to find and we heard one couple complain that they had used the wrong park and had been charged the full overnight rate. The proximity to the Powell and Mason Line enabled us to see most of the city very easily using the day pass which I think was about $20. Don't forget to visit the Cable Car Museum which is a real revalation as to how this ingenious system works. San Fransisco is a city worth another visit, as is this Hotel.",

The area near the Termini station is not the prettiest, but it is very convenient if you are using public transportation. My suggestion when exiting Termini station is to go RIGHT and walk down about 4 blocks and then right again and over 2 blocks. We were travelling with quite a bit of luggage and we ended up going the wrong way too many times. We had no problems in the area and loved the convenience of the location. We walked to Termini to either pick up the Metro train or a bus to most all of the sites. The room was spotless and the Breakfast was delicious. Assunta - the owner, could not have been more helpful, although her sense of direction is not like ours in America. Just a short walk maybe a lot longer than we Americans are used to. Hoping on the #70 bus gets you to almost any tourist site (or close to) and most buses all head back to Termini.",

However, it does offer limited parking and convenient location at a very inexpensive rate and the bathrooms were clean; it attracts tourists who are more interested in the surrounding neighborhoods (which are quite nice with wonderful restaurants) and less interested in where they stay for the night. There was a cafe down the street when I was there in 2002, it's along major bus lines, with a terrific market close by across the street. It is also right across from the CBS studios, and about four blocks walking from an old-style diner and bakery. The comments on other sites focus on the ethnic background of the clerks and manager, but I found them pleasant and accommodating. That is why I actually felt safe there as a single female traveler (although I suspect others would not feel this way).

I booked this through BOOKING.COM and payed Â£45. I have never stayed in Miami before so we did not know what areas were good and what was bad. When we checked in I wasa little concerned as there was a security hut and a guard at the door. We checked in and it was very run down and dirty. They asked for a credit card but I insisted on paying cash as there was no way I was going to hand over my card details. We parked our car and tried to find our room. The halls were all outdoors and very run down. There was a sign saying it had just had a refurb. I could not see where from the outside. It seemed that the area in Miami the motel was in was not a very good one, this concerned us a little. We finally found our room and went in. The room was very basic and smelt of damp. The dead lock on the door was broken and there was no safe in the room. We felt that uncomfortable that at night we pushed our suit cases up to the door. The shower had no presure and was only luke warm and the paint was peeling off from the bathroom. What really appauld us was the floor. I took my shoes and socks off and was walking around in bare foot. After two minutes my partner said \"LOOK AT YOUR FEET\". They were black. The floor was that dirty that in 2 mins my feet were black. I wet a towel and rubbed it along the floor. The towel changed to black and the carpet changed colour. The floor could do with a really good clean. The TV reception was very poor and fuzzy and we gave up in the end. Also the internet/Wifi had little/no signal. It was noisey outside and there were Police sirens sounding all night outside. We found it hard to sleep. We only stayed the night as we had to get up at 4 am to check in for our flight and we checked in at 8pm that evening. Otherwise we would have moved hotel. The only plus side was it was close to the airport. We did not stay for the breakfast but if itn was anything like the room we would have passed anyway. We did not use the pool as it was on the otherside of the motel right next to a main highway. It looked dirty and very uninviting. Please only stay at this motel if you have to or if it is free and you are feeling brave.",

        "content": "Loved it!! We stayed at Buena Vista Motor Inn for two nights in June and again in July, at the beginning and end of a round trip in California. And we were more than satisfied. Our room was great, clean and comfortable and the staff - Ken and Bernard in particular - was more than helpful and friendly. It is about 20 minutes walk from the central part of Fisherman's Wharf, cable cars, Alcatraz ferry etc. Sure, the parking lot is small, but it is free and according to the staff they will always be able to fit in a car per room even if it means double parking and leaving the keys at the front desk for them to move the car if necessary.There is a coffee maker in the room to keep you going until breakfast. The breakfast - muffins, pastry, fruit and juice - they serve at this hotel is neither better nor worse than so many other continental breakfasts at motels in California (according to our three weeks of experience). And up the road on the left side of the street is a great place for a freshly cooked breakfast, the Lombard Cafe. And going left maybe six blocks down the street from the hotel is Mel's Diner, a typical American diner with typical diner fare - and the best milk shakes we tasted in California.Buena Vista Motor Inn is highly recommended - we loved our stay there!",

The room was small but clean. The front desk staff were wonderful. They answered all our questions with a smile. Fisherman's Wharf is within walking distance. There's a Mel's Diner (remember American Graffiti) down the street about 6 blocks. The most we spent on cab fare to get around the city was about $12 dollars. This is a great location and a very clean, friendly motel. I will stay there whenever I am in San Francisco.",

Our room was large enough and very chic with modern decor and wooden floors. Furthermore, it was extremely clean, and cleaned everyday afterwards whilst we were out. The room overlooked a very pleasant garden to the rear, where breakfast and evening drinks were served. The staff were friendly and very helpful giving directions and recommending restaurants. The hotel is only 5 mins walk to Manzoni underground station, so it's very easy to get around the whole of Rome within minutes (it took about 20 mins to get from Manzoni to Vatican City on the underground). When the underground closes at 9pm, taxis are not hugely expensive (we got a taxi from Testaccio to the hotel,at 3am, for 15 euros). Breakfast was the typical selection of meats, cheeses, breads, cereals and juices. Though, there is a supermarket and cafes/restaurants just down the street. All in all, it was a great hotel for our week of sightseeing and nights out (24 hour open reception was very helpful).",

I was a single traveler staying for several days to enjoy horseracing at Del Mar. The hotel looks nice, but the service is terrible. I was told over the phone that I could get a free schuttle to the track, but in the morning I was told those are \"only for wedding parties.\" My room was nice. I was able to see the same dirt on the carpet every morning of my stay. I guess they don't vacuum. I ordered room service and it never came, twice! The female bartender was just nasty. I understand you need to talk to your friend on your cell, but could you get me the drink first? I also read that there would be cookies. Never saw any of them. When I checked out, I told the hotel clerk that my stay was terrible, he offered me a free night at the hotel. Why would I want to stay? There is a Hampton and a Marriott across the street. I don't know if they are any better, but I would consider them first next year when I visit Del Mar.",

The Family that owns the place actually work it. The Father shows up in the morning, giving out hot apple pie and visiting with guests While the continental breakfast is being done. The son is there as well and extremely helpful with tips about the area. On one of our days we wanted to go to an IN & OUT BURGER due to my son wanted to try it and the staff Thomas found one for us and gave us a GPS to use. On our day before we were to leave another great staff member did our boarding passes while we were at the San Diego Zoo. I would love to do a shout out to Steve and Thomas. We were in town to do the Midway Museum and this little motel made my Dad feel at home. It is in a great location surrounded by much higher price property's but I can assure you, this will be your place of choice in Point Loma from your first stay on......",

We have been visiting SD for over 4 years and have stayed in many hotels from Oceanside to Sanysidro, from o the bigger chains to the little trendy ones down in the Gaslamp district, to the highrises by the harbor, and we have to say that The Dolphin was just perfect for our needs. We love traveling around the area and so most of the time we spend in a hotel is to sleep and take a shower, well we had just what we needed and it was clean, efficient and just right. The folks there are so nice and very helpful. We arrived in SD around 9 AM and our room was all ready for us to take a nap after traveling all night. That in itself was a very pleasant surprise. And that it is located right in the middle of all of the boat action, yacht clubs, we were delighted. We decided to use public transit, so the bus stop was right there, and it was easy to connect with the trolley as well. We have rented cars before while visiting, but because it was so easy to get around using transit, we loved staying there at the Dolphin. We weren't at all disturbed by noise from the street, but if you have a problem with that, just use ear plugs, but truthfully the white noise from the air unit took care of that. The rooms are small, but adequate and the shower is great, no shortage on anything. Wifi, anything that you may need, and breakfast outside in the courtyard. Everyone was so nice, not a grumpy one in the bunch. Where have you been all our lives , Dolphin, we will be staying there again probably next summer. Do not hesitate to stay at the Dolphin, of course if you would rather spend a lot of money go elsewhere. We love the Dolphin and hope all reads this as a total 100% recommendation.I do think that this is one for quieter people, they don't allow loud parties so be mindful of that.There are places in the area for partying, just call a cab to get home. Or do like us and walk. One highlight for us was the trip to Pt Loma lighthouse, just walk down the street and catch the bus, it is a beautiful place. Thanks Dolphin!",

        "content": "I was doubious about staying at the Dolphin. The main thing that changed my mind was not just that it is one of the most affordable motels in San Diego, but that it's proprietor takes the time to read all these reviews and actually responds to many of them. That is the mark of someone who truely cares about his business. My husband and I stayed at the Dolphin for 5 days towards the end of October. Although the weather was disappointing the Dolphin was not. The building itself is an older building but it is very well maintained. Yes, the rooms are small, but the bed is very comfortable and the room was very clean and everything in it worked great - especially the shower (great water pressure!). A continental style breakfast was provided every morning in the courtyard - coffee, juice, bananas, yogurt, muffins, McDonalds apple pies,etc. We never had a problem finding parking. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. Even before we arrived for our stay, we were notified that the motel and surrounding area would be out of power the night we were to arrive. Jess provided us with a flashlight when we arrived. It is so rare to find people who actually enjoy thier job. Well, it was obvious that these folks do. I think the friendly and relaxed atmosphere that the staff creates, causes thier patrons to be more friendly as well. Whenever, we'd pass through the courtyard, other patrons would say hello or good morning. You're lucky if other people even look at you in public these days! My only advice to future patrons would be to be ready for thin walls. The folks next to us were not especially loud, but we could hear them talking pretty clearly through the walls. We turned the AC/Heat unit in the room on \"fan\" and that helped alot. So, if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs or turn on that fan. Otherwise, the other patrons were very respectful of the \"9pm-9am quiet time.\" Thank you to the Dolphin for running such an affordable and pleasant establishment! We'll definitely stay here again if we ever travel to SD again. ~M. Walsh",

The rooms are clean and white, and whilst not spacious they are fine for a couple. breakfast in the courtyard was a great start to the day. Be sure to ask the office staff for restaurant recommendations and \"coupons', we walked to dinner every night in a very safe area and really enjoyed the restaurants we visited. Customer service is their watchword, staff never far away which helped when i had a little tumble one morning, no damage done!! Next time we are in the area we will stay there agian, the value is fantastic.",

After all it's easy to find a good expensive hotel; but takes more work to find a less expensive one. There was something about the web site that attracted me, so I booked without further ado. We weren't disappointed. I won't waste time talking about the cleanliness and attentiveness of the owner and staff. They've been well covered. The thing I liked about it is the location, just across the street from a marina in between Harbor Island and Shelter Island. Our only transportation was bicycles; and the bike trail along the bay to downtown started only a block from the Dolphin. The bike lane on Nimitz Blvd made it easy to get to Ocean, Mission, and Pacific Beaches, as well as the bike trail around Mission Bay. Tip: The desk clerk tipped us off the first night to Mitch's Seafood practically across the street along the marina. We went back 3 times for the beer battered fish sandwich and fish tacos.",

Clean & firm bed, a clean bathroom with hot, pressured water, wifi internet, quiet sleep and morning coffee available are all that I need in a room. Dolphin provided all of that, a wakeup call, and an airport taxi call. Many would describe my room at the Dolphin as spartan college dorm style. I don't spend much time in my room when traveling. There was plenty of service from the staff. That included answering all of my questions via email when I was selecting my room, as well as doing their best during my brief stay.

First off this is very much a no frills place. Nothing fancy here folks. You will find the Dolphin in an excellent location, steps from the sea, fishing boats, dining options, and cute homes. Enough can't be said about the staff, homey, and genuinely friendly. You will likely meet the owner, I chatted with him several times. This is an older, well maintained place that is extraordinarily clean. You can practically eat off the floors inside and out. Parking is included with your room rate too. The rooms are fairly small, glossy white walls, frig, a place to hang clothes, shower with wildly high water pressure...you could power wash your boat with this thing. No tub. The walls are thin, you will hear your neighbors on occasion, this is a quiet place though, and will not pose a problem for most. A modest breakfast is provided near some outdoor tables, with umbrellas, it can be a very laid back sociable scene if you choose to get involved, or you can relax in solitude. Bottom line, for the price, location, cleanliness, and hospitality, you will seriously have a hard time beating this place. Although this is far from a 5 star hotel, for the price and everything else considered, I give it 5.",

The grounds were amazing (18 acres - more than half of that protected wetlands), the lobby and main entry room were beautiful, and the staff both professional and extremely courteous. Our room was perfect, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was very generously appointed. This hotel has living room areas in each of the guest buildings with complementary water, string cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and a selection of very delicious malt balls. Their shuttle will take you, free of charge, to the SeaTac light rail station, airport, and a local mall with some excellent restaurants (be sure to try Joey's at the Southcenter Mall) and a Target right across the street from the mall in case you have forgotten anything you need. When you're ready to return to the hotel, a quick call gets you a reasonably quick pickup and ride back. While we were within walking distance to the airport, we rarely heard airplane noise even when outside and never while inside. We could not have chosen a better place to spend our honeymoon.",

They also have living rooms in each off the buildings and they are fully stocked with chips, cookies, ice cream and water bottles. The rooms are fairly spacious and have a very clean and fresh scent. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets were some of the softest I've ever laid in. The bathroom was AMAZING with a huge soaking tub. My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship so staying in beautiful hotels for our weekend getaways is a thing that we have embedded into our relationship. I wanted our stay here in Seattle to be perfect and the Cedarbrook lodge is honestly one of the absolute best hotels we've ever stayed in during the past year and a half of our getaways.",

Also the customer service at the bars, dinner rooms, and front desk were wonderful. The best was a bartender named Pete. Very friendly and fun to talk to. I hope work sends me here again, it was a great stay! If you are needing to be near the Seattle airport, this is the best place.

        "content": "The location of this large resort made it very convenient to drive to the Disney Parks every day (we had a rental car). For us, since we were not staying at a Disney property, the location of this Resort was a huge plus. We stayed in the North Village and it was a very quiet area. By contrast, the West Village area seemed quite busy when we were checking in. The two bedroom condo was comfortable and clean. The screened-in porch with screen door access outside was nice, though there was a pile of cigarette butts just outside the door, which should be cleaned-up in my opinion. The \"backyard\" of the condo we were in was part of one of the golf courses. The golf course was lighted for night play, which I thought might be annoying if you were trying to go to bed, but it really did not cause any trouble. I'm not even sure when the lights go off - we were all so tired after spending every day in the parks we didn't really care. It also made the stay unique. I mean, how often do you see a lighted golf course? The course was not busy and my youngest son and I had some space to throw the football around. We did not use any of the pools while we were there, but did have some food and drinks in a couple of the pool areas. The pool areas seemed nice and the food and drinks were tasty. Check-in was easy, though once we checked in they did hit you up for the timeshare sales, which we declined and were never bothered again. The resort was clean and well maintained. There was no maid service for the week (although I believe you can request room cleaning for a fee), but it did have a washer and drier, which allowed us to pack far less for the week. The condo kitchen was very minimally stocked (nothing at all in the pantry or fridge so they probablty clean out anything that is left by prior vacationers). Fortunately, Target and Walmart are close (Target was right across from the resort) and there is a Publix (grocery store) that is right at the entrance to the resort, so there is no problem getting what you need to stock your condo. We did not take advantage of many of the resort's amenities and used the place as a convenient and cost effective place to stay off Disney property. It was perfect for that purpose. From what I could tell, I imagine that you could have a wonderful stay here if you wanted to use it as a \"destination resort\" with golf, swimming pools, food, activities, etc. It certainly appeared to have everything you would need for that purpose too.",

I was a little skeptical about staying somewhere that was 40 miles from the ocean and also about all of the stuff I had read regarding the high pressure timeshare pitch, but had an overall great experience. Our room: POSITIVE: I booked our room through booking.com and received a significant price discount for paying in advance. We had a studio (2 queens, pullout couch and efficiency kitchen with table). It was a perfect set-up for our family. The beds were comfy, we had plenty of linens to get us thru the 4 days and the room was clean. We were centrally located and could easily access our car or the pool or the front desk from our room. Our room: NEGATIVE: Although I had requested that we be placed at River Island, our room was actually at the West Village - directly behind the check-in area. Thru booking.com, I was not made aware that the room type we requested was not available at River Island. Also, I had been lead to believe each room room a washer & dryer but in our building, they were actually down the hall - we were given enough laundry soap for 4 or 5 loads and we did not need coins to operate the machines. Time Share Experience: Upon check in, I firmly declined the $20 free gift to the woman who approached me. Additionally, we unplugged the phone in the hotel room and were not asked again to attend any timeshare presentations. My advice is to be polite but firm with your \"no\"...and trash the $20 certificate...FREE is a 4 letter word. Pool & Surroundings: The pool at the West Village was super nice. There were plenty of towels and chairs. At River Island, our friends got up early to break the rules and reserve chairs. There were signs that stated that reserving chairs was not permitted but there was nobody enforcing it. In fact, the only thing that was strictly enforced were the $9 per day lazy river blue tubes! Everyone had their own cooler packed with food & drink & cocktails and after 5 days the only person I saw get in trouble were people without armbands that were riding on tubes in the lazy river...they literally have a hook that they grab them from people with in 2 different stops around the river. We took advantage of the 2 for $4 domestic draft beers for happy hour and our friends took advantage of the $14.95 refillable soft drink container. Our kids liked the virgin daquiris with the $3 refills. Dining: We ate a Breezes one night and Pisan's pizza place. They were both average...the kids meals are all under $5.99 and I found the adult items to be reasonably priced. We went to Publix and got yummy Boars Head sandwiches a couple of times and we also kept breakfast & lunch stuff in our room. Other: None of us were a big fan of people smoking at the pool. It seemed like there were people smoking everywhere. Additionally, at the end of our hotel hall was an exit to outside and people stood outside that door and smoked so we had to walk thru it on our way to the pool. I even saw an employee standing there...we stayed at the Renaissance @ Sea World earlier in the week and they had a no-smoking policy in the pool area...that was super. My only other complaint was that the hotel rooms were super nice, but the hallway still had dingy ceiling tiles and the stairwells (by ashtray) and area by the stairwell entrances at West Village were dirty...they needed to be swept & painted. Overall a 4/5 experience.",

        "content": "We just returned from a 2 night stay in a 2 br villa in the North Village of Orange Lake Resort. It was a little overwhelming driving into the resort because it is so huge & there are so much housing. Many of the areas have single story housing complexes, which you park directly in front of and it easy for loading & unloading the car. The villa was very nice with big rooms & bathrooms. We traveled with 2 kids, ages 11 and 2.The lagoon pool is good for toddlers because it has a kiddie pool, zero entry pool, and fountain area. That pool area also has a small slide, basketball goal in the pool, volleyball net, and arcade area for the older kids. The river pool has a lazy river, zero entry pool, 2 slides, and also was right next to the mini golf, huge inflattable slide, rock climbing, & bungie trampoline. We will return. If you have a citicard you can use your CitiCash to get discounted rates. Avoid the timeshare sales pitch by telling them that you already heard the pitch when you booked the room over the phone.",

        "content": "After reading the bad reviews I was a little skeptical about this place but I'm glad I went with my gut instincts and stayed here. I wish I could say our trip went without a hitch but feel I must mention that the first villa they put us in wreaked of smoke (4022 West Village) however all it took was a call to the front desk and we were moved to unit 4285. They sent a van to help us since it was almost ten o'clock at night. We stayed 5 nights six days in a two bedroom villa in the West Village and loved every minute of it! Villa was very spacious for My husband and I plus my sister and our two year old. Two bedrooms and two full huge baths. Kitchen was outfitted nicely with washer and dryer large pantry, dishwasher and everything you need to cook all your meals there. It really was a home away from home. They provided dishwasher detergent (3 loads) clothes detergent 3 loads (so nice not to have to do a weeks worth of washes at home!) Also there was toilet paper and tissues as well as dishtowels stocked in each bathroom and kitchen. Beds were very comfortable as well as furnishings, must say again the furnishings in this unit were a little nicer in quality and age. Bathrooms and closets were more than adequate. Resort was spectacular the River Island area was gorgeous and lots to do for the whole family. Fees were not outrageous and I could see staying on resort the whole time however the Disney parks are no more than 20 minutes away. We did Hollywood studios (15 minutes) and Magic Kingdom (20 minutes with parking and all). We dined at the River Island Grilling Company and had a great meal great service and the food was reasonable. Also did the sunset celebration at the West Village Clubhouse restaurant more casual and also very good. No problems with any smell other than smoke in the first room, no issues with their sales pitch for the vacation club, I declined they still gave me my $20 resort coupon (which we didn't use), no issues with the cleanliness or comfort of the room. My only negative would be that there is only one way in and out which sometimes you have to wait for either at the gate and also you have to drive quite a bit to get to the other places of interest, pools bars restaurants in the resort but there was plenty of parking and we never had a issue.",

When we checked in, the time share appointment people greeted us with offers; when we hesitated to take a time share (no obligation) tour.They sweeten the pot to $100 for only a 90 minute tour. We took the tour, what 90 minutes? It was 3 hours of sales pitching and they worked us over with 4 people. Beware - They have a hard time taking NO for an answer. Other than this and some Internet connections problems for our iPad. We enjoyed our stay very much. We highly recommend this Country Club Resort.",

        "content": "This was a relaxing and fantastic vacation, after we escaped the sales staff once and for all. I made a mistake the first day in being too kind and that was a big mistake. I approached the check in desk and began the process of getting our keys. After the brief check in was finished, they directed me over to another counter where they showed me all these discounts I could get if I took a tour of the property. Whenever someone tells you they want 45 minutes of your time, RUN. The 45 minutes tour took over 3 hours - all with a 14 month old crying baby. I realize they are there to sell you a vacation rental but to put us through 4 or 5 people who hold you captive after saying NO over and over was really annoying. After that horrid experience was over, we had a wonderful vacation. We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa which was perfect for a family of 5. It was clean and very comfortable. It was safe to go for walks around the resort but we needed to hop in the car for a 4 minute drive to the main waterpark area because we had 3 small kids in tow. The pools were fun and not overly crowded even though we were there at March break. The poolside bars and restaurants were very reasonably priced and we relaxed in the warm sun while sipping on our drinks. We would definitely stay there again and will know to avoid any discount tickets offered. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.",

This was our first visit to Orange Lake, and we loved the well-maintained, spacious grounds and the privacy of a roomy villa. Our reservation was for 2 weeks, but I could have stayed longer. West Village is perfect for retirees wanting to escape cold, northern winters. The villas are ground level and parking for the car is just a few steps from the front door. The villa seemed to be older but appeared to be recently refurbished. Maintenance requests were handled promptly. The kitchen is well-equipped with a full-size range, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and washer/dryer. There are cabinets for food storage above the laundry area. Paper products are provided, along with coffee for the first morning. Sliding glass doors led to the rear patio from both the living room and the master bedroom. The bathrooms are small, but all other rooms are large. A heated pool was a short walk away. The pool and hot tub enclosure held an ample supply of lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas. The pool towels are small but adequate. There are 2 more pools near the West Village Clubhouse about a 15-minute walk from the villa. If you want an even larger pool complex, you can take the shuttle to the beautiful River Island. North Village and East Village have pools, also. This resort is huge. We wasted the first few days at this wonderful resort trying to find fault with the place. Why? We attended a “member update” on the morning after our arrival. It was not a good experience. We chose not to accept their proposal and left the meeting with bitter feelings. I recommend that the sales presentation be scheduled for later in the visit, after you have an opportunity to enjoy some of what the resort has to offer.",

        "content": "We are owners at Orange Lake and have stayed here numerous times. We just returned last night from our vacation and are disappointed in our stay. At check-in we were given the opportunity to sign up for an owners update meeting, we understood that this was a sales pitch to try and convince us to switch our week into their points system. We were told it was an hour long meeting, but having sat through these before we understood that most likely it would go longer. The salesman who came over to help us was named Randall. He explained that he was not an employee of Orange Lake but instead contracted out to talk to individuals like us, who had a timeshare that was paid for in full but had not yet moved their week to points. He assured us that we would not have anyone else come over to talk to us because we were \"veterans\" of this process and therefore he would be taking care of everything. It is amazing how kind the sales team are as they are attempting to sell to you, and how quickly it changes once they realize you are not going to purchase anything. After his pitch, my husband and I said that we weren't interested in purchasing anything. Randall then had to take a call from his wife, and sent in someone else to offer us a new deal. It was such a scam! I told the next person that we were not interested in changing anything right now, once again this person became rude to us. I told him that one reason we will not put in anymore money to Orange Lake was because how rude they became during the presentation. Yesterday as we were packing up ready to go, my brother could not find his camera, we lifted the mattress up to look for it and saw this HUGE wad of dark black body hair lying on the box spring. I can't even begin to say how disgusting that was, to know that it had been there the whole week. My husband mentioned it to someone as he checked out and they said \"oh ok\", no one seemed to care. As current owners I am not sure if we will return to Orange Lake. I do know we won't be purchasing any upgrades to our current plan because of some of the experiences we have had at Orange Lake.",

        "content": "We just returned from a 4-night stay at the Orange Lake Resort in Orlando. We had a 2 bedroom unit in the west village, which was extremely clean and spacious. Two adults and 3 children (2 teens and a 'tween) comfortably shared the space, though one child chose to sleep on the sofa in the living room. The kitchen was very well-equipped with all the implements you could want for basic cooking, and had granite counters. The washer-dryer was useful and worked well. Bathrooms were spacious and clean, including the jacuzzi-style tub in the master bath. The complex seems to be in good repair. We were in Orlando for a soccer tournament, so we wanted space to relax between games, and got that. If I were there for a vacation, though, I would be disappointed with the amenities. Swimming pools seemed small, and even in December the miniature golf courses were crowded. Restaurants and the Marketplace mini-mart were expensive for what they offered. The River complex pool looked fun but too small for the vast size of the resort overall. Security at the gate was rather over-zealous, but it's easy to get in if you tell them you are checking in. The architecture is extremely monotonous, but not hideous. Friends who were also staying said the golf was pleasant but not memorable. As a place to stay, a larger-than-average hotel, it was fine. If I went there with the idea that it would provide entertainment for several days, I'd be disappointed. One nice touch was the array of starter goodies provided in the unit: dish soap, paper towels, laundry detergent, coffee. It was pricey but I'm sure a better deal could be had if you could be more flexible with your dates. Beware - they will try to get you into a sales session for the timeshare. And when you say no,they will call your unit to invite you yet again (to be fair, they offered $100 to come to the session). We were honest and said the only reason we were there was for a soccer tournament, and wouldn't want to vacation in Orlando otherwise, and they respected that and left us alone. Maybe those are the magic words? (Never a mention of a charge not to attend the sales pitch, btw.) Service was friendly and prompt - we were missing a couple small items from our unit and they delivered them promptly, and phone inquiries to various departments were answered quickly and accurately. The people working here are very friendly and helpful, and the housekeeping is excellent. The 7:05 AM shuttle to Disney cost about $20 each and was well worth the money.",

        "content": "We stayed at Orange Lake the week of December 4-11, 2011. I booked the rooms through world resorts international’s Buy with Me deal, and got 7 nights for a great price. After reading the reviews, I didn’t know what to expect when we checked in, however, we were pleasantly surprised! Recommend this place for families looking for vacation rental amenities and not hotel amenities. Check-in/Check-Out No wait and courteous staff. The only criticism is the time-share tactics. The receptionist gave me the room key and $20 voucher. My family was waiting in the car, so I walked out to meet them. On my way out, the timeshare rep pounced! And when I told her that I had to meet my family, she said that I had to give her the $20 voucher back. It was the strangest thing. I knew that the voucher was a timeshare ploy, but if I knew they would demand it back if not used immediately, I would have declined to take it in the first place. But that was not a big deal because overall the staff was very courteous. After getting to our room, my husband called the front desk and asked if we could be moved off of ground level. They gave us several options and were very accommodating so overall I would rate the reception staff as excellent and the timeshare group as rough around the edges (we had to unplug our phones because they literally called us non-stop even after we picked up and said we weren’t interested.). Property We stayed on the 5th floor of the East Village. It looked like this was a recently renovated/built section because the rooms were clean with modern décor. The receptionist said that all rooms in the East Village are similar. The entire property is huge! It took about 5 minutes to drive from the reception to the East Village because of the winding roads, golf carts, pedestrians, etc. Driving through, it looks like the West Village and possibly North Village as well, are the older, one level rooms. They actually look like little houses. I’m not sure how they look on the inside, but I don’t think I would want to stay there. I like the more modern look and feel of the East village. I loved that there was a pool in the East Village and a restaurant as well. There are like 8-10 places to eat on the resort and at least 4-5 deliver until 10pm. We ate at The Legends once and the food was OK. We did not really use the amenities on the resort. We went to the pool once in the East Village. It was very quiet and cold during our stay. There is a lazy river in River Island, but we never checked it out. The property has a great location, with a Publix, Walgreens, Target right next door. Very convenient! Also, this place so close to Disney. We went to Magic Kingdom and after the hustle and bustle of getting into and out of the park, it was nice that our ride home was less than 10-15 minutes. Room We had a 2 bedroom condo. It was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The kitchen was equipped with cooking essentials, although a few pots and pans needed replacing and one burner was broken. The TVs are dated, but the living room has a DVD player which was nice. The bedroom TVs had bad reception. They have extra sheets and blankets for the sofa bed. We found one blanket had food stains on it, but thankfully the place was equipped with a washer/dryer and detergent. Overall the imperfections did not stress me because of the deal I received, but it would bother me more if I would have paid full price. I would stay here again, and would recommend this place to family and friends.",

The shuttle is great and restaurant prices are moderate. We are staying in West Village-fourth floor condo and love it. They supply you with detergent, dish soap, dish washer soap and even salt and pepper. The condo is recently decorated and CLEAN. Walgreen and Target nearby.",

        "content": "Not a very good stay at this property! The downsides for me were many. The location of the property is very difficult to find and when you do find it, it is difficult to get to it. The location is costly because there are tolls associated with getting to it, if you don't know the none toll road way to get to it. I was fortunate that I lived in Miami for three years and knew the roadways very well. The fact that this property does not include any continental breakfast shocked me. There is a deli and coffee shop inside with plenty of seating. But the prices for food and drinks were a little high for my liking. One would think that since the property was far off the beaten path the management would offer some form of discount or reduce costs for patrons. As far as other issues with this property, the jacuzzi was not hot at all. It was mostly luke warm at best. The elevator was broken 2 of the 4 days I stayed. The maintenance of the building is lacking. The bright spot of the stay was the people at the front desk. They were very responsive to all issues but was unable to get them fixed. I guess the maintenance department needs new help. I probably will not stay at this property again or recommended it to anyone.",

The only Marriot with a shuttle you have to call first if you want to be picked up at the airport. - A big flat screen HD TV in your room to distract you from all the above. Do you watch TV? Should you ever decide to stay at this place I would highly recommend renting a car. Cabs in Miami can make your visit a nightmare.",

The staff are friendly enough and the public areas are good. The rooms are big, clean and the beds are fantastic, free internet access too. The 'restaurant' only opens for breakfast and theres no bar so evening meals will be walking or driving - or you can get something from the 'Market' which is a small fridge next to reception with a couple of sandwiches in it. Would I stay again? As a tourist no, as a one nighter before going to the airport the next day, yes. Note this is a 100% no smoking hotel.",

The staff was eager to help. I got in and loved the suite! A full kitchen, living room area, bar seating and a dining table. There was a small balcony, but it was sufficient. The gym was very small and had few machines and noe weights. I was thankful I was the only one there. I loved the sun deck on the lake and the pool was large enough not to be crowded. The restaurant is small, but the bar tender was spot on when reccomending my dinner and he was helpful, friendly and very nice to a solo traveler.",

        "content": "Our family--parents in their early 50's, grown children in their 20's--stayed at Lake Eve for one night during a long weekend in December 2011. We had a 2-bedroom unit on the 7th floor and were extremely happy with all the extra space. Lots of closets, plenty of towels, a large kitchen with major appliances, an in-room safe--all the extras were there. The beds and furniture seem newish. The master bath has a tub and a separate shower, two sinks, and two huge closets. The location is at the far southern end of International Drive, next door to the Premium Outlets Mall. There is a Publix grocery store within strolling distance (although it might be a bit much to stroll back with groceries) so it's easy to stock up on food and beverages instead of spending a fortune at area restaurants. The guests are a mix of US, Canadian, German and Brazilian citizens and it seems to appeal to families attending sports tournaments at Disney's Wide World of Sports complex. The desk staff was congenial --although if this was my hotel, I'd ask them to dress with a bit more professional polish. And that's the only thing lacking at Lake Eve. It's got top-notch condos, great amenities and a perfect location to enjoy the Disney parks--it only needs to step up its image and service to make it one of the more desireable stays in the Orlando area.",

        "content": "We are a family of six-- my husband & I with 3 teenage girls & a 10 year old son. We always look for a hotel suite or multiple rooms when we vacation. Lake Eve was perfect! We searched through Booking.com for a good deal & this was the best we found. A 3 bedroom suite for $149! I questioned whether it was in a good area & whether it was a nice place. We looked at the reviews & the worst reviews were that it didn't have free wi-fi in the rooms so we did a little research on the hotel website and found out that's not even true. When we arrived there was free valet parking, which was a plus. When we got to our room, we were VERY happy. The kitchen was very spacious. The dining table was large enough for all of us. The living area was ample. The balcony was huge! We had a view of the beautiful pool & lake. The bedrooms were a good size and warm & cozy. Bathrooms were pretty & clean. Everything seemed new & updated, We did have free wi-fi in our room. We ALL got a good night sleep, also, as the beds were very comfortable. We have nothing negative to say about our room. We were in Orlando to go to Universal. I almost didn't book Lake Eve because I wanted something close to Universal. But since we were so close to I-4 it didn't take long to get there and it was very EASY to get there. We loved that Lake Eve was situated on a quiet area of International Drive and yet so close to I-4. The only downer to our stay was in the morning when we all wanted breakfast. There was a breakfast buffet for $8 or you could order a la carte items. The buffet reminded us of nicer continental breakfast bars we've had at other hotels for free-- not worth $8. Some of the a la carte items on the menu looked good & reasonably priced but we opted to go out to breakfast where there was more variety. We went to the Denny's down the street. We ARE NOT Denny's fans-- we never go at home. But we were starving! This Denny's was actually not bad--we were pleasantly surprised! We are very happy that we ended up at Lake Eve. It was perfect for our family. We'd definitely go back!",
