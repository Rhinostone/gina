/**
 * @module gina/core/connectors/couchbase/storage-store
 *
 * Couchbase-backed `StorageMetaStore` for the object-storage layer
 * (`lib/storage`) — the FIRST connector store of the #STO1 family, and the
 * supported answer to the embedded backend's documented
 * single-process-per-driver-root boundary. Backed by the consumer project's
 * own `couchbase` driver (SDK major 3 or 4), resolved at construction — the
 * framework keeps zero hard dependency on it.
 *
 * What it buys over the embedded SQLite store: the metadata row lives on a
 * cluster every pod reaches, so several bundles (or replicas) can share ONE
 * driver root. That is not a performance nicety — SQLite's locking is a
 * known-broken story on a shared network filesystem, so a shared root is
 * exactly what the embedded store refuses to support.
 *
 * **Per-key atomicity comes from Couchbase's own CAS**, which the refcount
 * verbs need (`acquireRef` is what makes two concurrent identical `put()`s
 * yield one blob and two references instead of a lost update). Every
 * read-modify-write verb is a `get` → `mutateIn(..., {cas})` loop: the
 * sub-document mutation applies all-or-none and only if the document has not
 * changed since the read, so a lost update is impossible and a concurrent
 * writer costs a bounded retry. CAS-guarded writes execute against the ACTIVE
 * vBucket only (replicas serve reads, never writes), so the loop stays correct
 * across a failover — each retry re-reads whatever node is active now.
 *
 * **Multi-process sweep coordination is the store's atomic claim, by design.**
 * `removeIfZero` is a CAS-guarded `remove`: when several processes sweep the
 * same root concurrently, exactly one claim per blob succeeds and every other
 * one reads `CasMismatchError` / `DocumentNotFoundError` and skips — so the
 * `local-cas` sweep protocol (claim the row FIRST, unlink second) is safe
 * without any election layer, and adding one would close no gap while making
 * `storage:gc` report `collected: 0` on whichever replica did not hold the
 * lease. The residual the seam documents is unchanged and is NOT a
 * sweeper-vs-sweeper race: it is put-vs-sweep (a fresh publish racing the
 * unlink), mitigated by the grace window, the put-side heal and
 * `storage:verify`.
 *
 * **Durability, stated rather than implied.** By default mutations use the
 * SDK's own default level (in-memory on the active node), which is the same
 * honesty class as the embedded store's SQLite WAL at `synchronous=NORMAL` —
 * a crash can lose the most recent acknowledged write. Couchbase failover can
 * likewise lose durably-written data. Consequences here are asymmetric and
 * worth knowing: a lost `acquireRef` undercounts (a blob may reach zero early
 * — gated by the grace window, adjudicated by the claim, visible to
 * `storage:verify`), while a lost `releaseRef` overcounts and that blob is
 * never collected. Set `durability` on the connectors.json entry when the
 * content justifies the latency.
 *
 * Data layout — ONE JSON document per metadata row:
 *
 *   <prefix><driver>:<key>   the row. `d` (driver name) and `k` (logical key)
 *                            are the sargable discriminators every query
 *                            filters on; the contract fields ride beside them
 *                            (`originalName`, `contentType`, `size`,
 *                            `createdAt`), with `data` present only for
 *                            size-tiered inline objects and `refs`/`zeroAt`
 *                            present only on refcounted (cas) rows.
 *
 * The payload rides as a **base64 STRING inside the JSON document**, not as a
 * binary document body: Couchbase cannot parse, index or query a binary value
 * (it is retrievable by key alone), which would make `listZeroRefs` / `stats`
 * structurally impossible — and the refcount and the payload must sit under
 * ONE CAS for the verbs above to be atomic. The cost is base64's +33%: with
 * the shipped 64KB tiering threshold a row is ~85KB, far below Couchbase's
 * 20MB document ceiling, but an `inlineThreshold` above ~14MB would overflow
 * it and the SDK will refuse the write.
 *
 * Config keys follow the couchbase connector's OWN conventions (the §11 rule —
 * mirrors `connector.v4.js` / the session store): `protocol` + `host` +
 * `username` + `password` + `database` (the BUCKET name — the same field the
 * model layer's entity scan reads), plus `scope` / `collection` (both
 * `_default`), `prefix` and the optional `durability`.
 *
 * Constructed by the `lib/storage-store` dispatcher at boot; not meant to be
 * instantiated from application code.
 *
 * @example
 *   // connectors.json
 *   // { "assetsMeta": { "connector": "couchbase", "protocol": "couchbase://",
 *   //                   "host": "db1.internal", "username": "gina",

 *   //                   "database": "gina_storage" } }
 *   // settings.json
 *   // { "storage": { "drivers": { "assets": {
