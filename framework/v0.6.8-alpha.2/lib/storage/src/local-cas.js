/**
 * @module lib/storage/local-cas
 * @description The `local` adapter crossed with the `cas` strategy —
 * content-addressed storage for immutable content (invoices, receipts,
 * anything a client can usefully ask "do you already have this?" about).
 *
 * **The key IS the blob address**: `blobs/<algo>/<aa>/<bb>/<hex>` — the digest
 * algorithm is a path segment, so an algorithm change is ADDITIVE (old blobs
 * stay addressable under their namespace, new writes land under the new one,
 * and dedup correctly does not span the two), while a STRATEGY change on
 * populated storage remains a re-key migration. Two `put()`s of identical
 * bytes return the SAME key with the reference count at 2 — that is the dedup.
 * Keys are extension-less BY CONSTRUCTION: the extension would derive from the
 * untrusted `originalName`, and identical bytes uploaded under different names
 * would then mint different keys, silently breaking dedup — `contentType`
 * lives in the metadata row instead. Keys remain OPAQUE to callers even
 * though they look parseable: `findByDigest()` exists precisely so nobody
 * composes one.
 *
 * **Hashing happens in the same pass as the write** — `hash.update(chunk)`
 * per chunk, never a whole-object buffer, never a re-read of the temp file.
 * SHA-256 by default: hardware-accelerated on every deployment target and two
 * orders of magnitude faster than the network that feeds the write path, with
 * zero dependencies (`node:crypto`). The configured name is validated against
 * the RUNTIME's `crypto.getHashes()` at boot — measured 2026-08-13: `sha256`
 * and `sha512` exist on both supported runtimes, `blake2b512` is Node-only.
 *
 * **`release()` drops a reference; the GC sweep deletes.** Deletion is never
 * synchronous: a blob whose count reaches 0 is stamped with the time it got
 * there and lingers for the grace window, so re-uploading just-released
 * content is free (`acquireRef` resurrects the row and clears the stamp). The
 * sweep claims a blob by deleting its row FIRST (`removeIfZero` — a guarded
 * delete a concurrent resurrection always beats) and unlinks the file second:
 * the inverse order could lose bytes under a racing dedup-hit `put()`, while
 * this order's crash window merely orphans an UNREFERENCED file — harmless,
 * and scrubbing belongs to the `storage:verify` CLI (`verify()` below). In-process the
 * race cannot interleave at all: the embedded store is synchronous and so are
 * the sweep's file ops, so acquire→check→publish and claim→unlink each run in
 * one uninterruptible JS turn. Across processes (a future async connector
 * store) the protocol keeps the grace window + claim-first ordering + the
 * heal path, and the store contract documents the residual.
 *
 * **Durability (`fsync: true`, the cas default).** The temp file is fsynced
 * BEFORE `rename(2)` publishes it, and the parent directory is fsynced after
 * — without the directory flush, the rename's directory entry is not durable
 * across power loss even though the file's bytes are. The directory half is
 * BEST-EFFORT: platforms and filesystems that cannot fsync a directory
 * (Windows; some network mounts) skip it silently, and macOS honours fsync
 * as the platform defines it (the stronger F_FULLFSYNC barrier would need a
 * native addon, which the framework does not ship). The file half is never
 * skipped while `fsync` is on — its failure fails the `put()`. An INLINE
 * write (below `inlineThreshold`) is one metadata-store transaction, whose
 * durability is the store's (embedded default: SQLite WAL with
 * `synchronous=NORMAL` — a crash can lose the last committed transaction,
 * never a torn row).
 *
 * **Content addressing makes in-place mutation impossible** — editing
 * produces a new blob and a new key. That is correct for legally-immutable
 * documents and wrong for anything with random writes; pick `sharded` there.
 *
 * @example
 * // settings.json — a cas driver for immutable documents
 * // { "storage": { "drivers": { "invoices": {
 * //     "adapter": "local", "strategy": "cas",
 * //     "root": "/var/data/invoices", "maxObjectSize": "50MB"
 * // } } } }
 * var s = gina.storage('invoices');
 * s.put(readStream, { originalName: 'invoice.pdf', contentType: 'application/pdf' },
 *     function (err, res) {
 *         if (err) { return next(err); }
 *         // res => { key, size, contentType, deduplicated }
 *         // identical bytes stored twice => the SAME key, deduplicated: true
 *     });

     * Both directions are AGE-GATED past the grace window, because each has a

     *   - a file younger than grace may belong to work in flight (and the

     *     `--fix` offline; nothing in this driver enforces that, the caller
     *     owns it.
     *   - `row-without-file` — a file-backed row (refs ≥ 1, no inline
     *     payload) whose bytes are gone. That is LOSS EVIDENCE: reported,
     *     never auto-fixed — deleting the row would destroy the only signal
     *     that content vanished. Zero-ref rows are skipped: their content is
     *     unreachable through every verb already, and the sweep's claim +
     *     ENOENT-tolerant unlink self-heals them, so reporting would flap.
     *
     * The rows direction needs row enumeration, which is OPTIONAL seam
     * surface (`listKeys`): a store lacking it degrades to the files
     * direction only, flagged by `rowsChecked: false`.
