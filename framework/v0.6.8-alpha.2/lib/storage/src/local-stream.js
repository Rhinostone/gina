/**
 * @module lib/storage/local-stream
 * @description The `local` adapter crossed with the `stream` strategy — large
 * sequential media on the local filesystem, with **resumable uploads**.
 *
 * **The key names an ASSET, not a file**: `assets/<ulid>/original<ext>`. The
 * per-asset directory is the namespace future renditions land in (`preview`,
 * `thumb`, a transcoded variant); `original` is the reserved base-rendition
 * name. No rendition API ships in this slice — the layout reserves the room.
 * Keys stay OPAQUE: callers store what `finalize()`/`put()` returns and never
 * parse the directory out of it.
 *
 * **What per-asset colocation actually buys, stated honestly.** It is
 * OPERATIONAL grouping — one `rm -rf` removes an asset and everything derived
 * from it, one `rsync` moves a subtree. It is NOT physical locality: a
 * directory does not place extents, the allocator does. And gina neither
 * prevents nor can prevent fragmentation — Node exposes no `fallocate`
 * binding, native addons are not shipped, and `ftruncate` produces a fully
 * SPARSE file (measured: 256MB truncate ⇒ 0 blocks on disk), so it reserves
 * nothing and gives neither anti-fragmentation nor an early ENOSPC.
 * Contiguity is a filesystem/volume concern (XFS extent hints and the like).
 * The same honesty the `cas` slice applied to `F_FULLFSYNC`.
 *
 * **Resumable uploads: the filesystem IS the manifest.** A session lives at
 * `<root>/.uploads/<uploadId>/` and holds exactly three kinds of entry —
 * `data` (the file being assembled in place, written POSITIONALLY so segments
 * may arrive out of order), `meta.json` (written ONCE at create through
 * temp+rename, so its state is binary: present-and-parseable, or absent), and
 * one zero-byte `<offset>-<length>.ok` marker per DURABLE range. Nothing about
 * a session touches the metadata store, and the seam gains ZERO new verbs.
 *
 * The argument for that home is FATE-SHARING, not seam economy: the manifest
 * must share crash-fate and fsync-ordering with the bytes it describes.
 * `fsync(data)` happens-before the marker is created, which is enforceable
 * only while both live on the same medium. A store-backed manifest (SQLite
 * WAL, redis, couchbase) can survive a crash the bytes did not, and a manifest
 * claiming a range the bytes lost passes the coverage check and publishes
 * ZEROS — reintroducing, through desync, exactly the hazard the coverage check
 * exists to close.
 *
 * **The zero-fill hazard, and why coverage is an INTERVAL UNION.** A hole in a
 * sparse file reads back as zeros, not as an error (measured). So a finalise
 * that did not verify coverage would publish a plausible, silently zero-filled
 * object. Verifying by SUMMING marker lengths is not enough either: markers
 * `0–8MB` and `4–12MB` sum to 16MB while `12–16MB` is uncovered. Coverage is
 * therefore computed by sorting the markers, merging overlapping and adjacent
 * spans, and requiring exactly ONE span equal to `[0, expectedSize)`.
 *
 * **Durability (`fsync: true`, the stream default).** Per segment: positional
 * write → `fsync(data)` → create the marker. Only the DATA fsync is
 * load-bearing; the marker's own durability is deliberately not guaranteed,
 * because a lost marker beside present bytes costs a re-send, which is the
 * safe direction. Measured: a process killed with SIGKILL after an un-fsynced
 * write still yields the full bytes to a later reader — the page cache carries
 * them — so markers stay honest across PROCESS death without fsync; only power
 * loss or a kernel panic opens the window. The cost is a RANGE, not the single
 * flattering figure: ~12ms per 8MB segment is ~2% of network-paced ingest at
 * 100 Mbps, ~19% at 1 Gbps, and fsync-DOMINANT at 10 Gbps. A LAN-ingest
 * consumer sets `fsync: false` and accepts the documented window. Inherits the
 * `cas` slice's per-platform honesty: the parent-directory flush is
 * best-effort, and macOS honours `fsync` as the platform defines it.
 *
 * **Multi-process: documented, not enforced.** Parallel segment writes are
 * safe when the ranges are DISJOINT — measured on a POSIX-coherent local
 * filesystem: two uncoordinated processes interleaving 1MB stripes into one
 * shared file produced byte-exact output. On relaxed-coherence network mounts
 * (GlusterFS and friends) that has NOT been measured; route one session's
 * segments to one process there. Nothing in this driver enforces affinity —
 * cross-process discovery does not exist in this layer.
 *
 * **No tiering, no hashing.** A multi-gigabyte strategy has no business
 * inlining its payload into a metadata row, and the write path deliberately
 * does not hash. Setting `inlineThreshold` or `hash` on a `stream` driver
 * therefore warns as an ignored key rather than silently doing nothing —
 * `capabilities.inline` and `capabilities.dedup` are both `false`.
 *
 * @example
 * // settings.json — a stream driver for large media
 * // { "storage": { "drivers": { "media": {
 * //     "adapter": "local", "strategy": "stream",
 * //     "root": "/var/data/media", "maxObjectSize": "5GB", "chunkSize": "8MB"
 * // } } } }
 * var s = gina.storage('media');
 * s.createUpload({ expectedSize: 4294967296, originalName: 'talk.mp4' },
 *     function (err, session) {
 *         if (err) { return next(err); }
 *         // session => { uploadId, chunkSize, expectedSize }
 *     });
