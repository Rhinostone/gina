As an American you are used to nicer hotels, but european hotels are....more like a bad Motel 6 experience to say the least. You put up with it because well.....You are IN VENICE! Or Paris or somewhere else spectacular. But, I was pleasantly surprised by our hotel. I must say that finding it was not easy, but wondering around in Venice is never a bad experience. The front desk staff were very nice and helpful. You will have to get an internet access code every 2 hours, but they had surprisingly good internet access. The rooms were very large compared to european standards and very clean. Our bathroom was also HUGE compared to european standards and we also had a large rain showerhead and a shower door! I was thrilled. Our room had french doors that opened onto a small cobble stone courtyard and a minifridge. They also had the biggest towels that I've ever seen in Italy. The location was wonderful. You just follow the signs to St. Mark's or Rialto and you can walk anywhere. We did get lost one night, but that was part of the fun of it. It is in a quite location but even in the back area's of Venice there are plenty of restaurants and shops right around the corner. I would definately stay here again.",

                "content": "Domina Home Ca' Zusto was an excellent choice for our four day stay in Venice. It is a small hotel in the San Croce district, deceptively nondescript from the outside, yet once inside, abundant marble, lovely staircases, warm and very lively decor, just minutes from San Marco and the Rialto bridge. We found it easily right off the Vaparetto as others have remarked. You do need to follow the directions as one is easily and quickly lost in Venice's winding and tall alleys, charming later not so much when first arriving tired with suitcases. The front desk staff were consistently patient and very helpful, the staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. Our room was very clean, It had a jetted bath/shower, and views of rooftops, and the narrow street, at first disappointing, but I grew to enjoy it as you start to notice the varied balconies, shutters, potted plants. Generous breakfast was included with scrambled eggs, bacon and other cold meats, cheeses, greens, tomatoes, canned peaches, yogurts, dry cereals, breads, pastries, and fresh fruit. Many families stayed there as well as couples, the venue appeared to work well for both. Coffee, espresso, cappuccino, tea, cocoa served by the friendly server, as noted in another review, and at no additional fee. Any time you spend on how to read the street signs will not be wasted. I found the maps not that helpful, but looked for landmarks, and by the end of the second day was feeling more comfortable, very comfortable, moving from San Marco/Rialto to the hotel, a 15-20 min walk. Easy easy easy to get lost, which was never scary, Venice feels so safe, however, one helpful hint is to key to the posted (written on walls, usually in yellow, some added as hand written notes on arches--none consistent, but often enough to be helpful) main directions for the Rialto and San Marco, and then your closest vapporetto. Recommend San Marco visit early in the day, you will find a line by 0830, it opens at 0945, but worth it, and you are waiting in the shade, unlike later when the line is longer, and in the sun. Go right upstairs (before the crowds), it cost about five euros, but the view is stunning both of the cupola mosaics, and then outside, the grand canal and square. Another reason to stay at Ca' Zusto: it is close to a very wonderful restaurant, \"Trattoria Al Ponte Del Megio\" just a two minute easy walk from the hotel, get a table on the canal people watch while enjoying some of the best food Venice has to offer. Other: AIr conditioner worked very well and was adjusted easily. Elevator worked well to the second floor. A separate smaller elevator from second to third, I could not get it to work--but perhaps it was simply too slow and I did not wait long enough. This second one will fit only one person, and if in a wheelchair, would recommend you ck dimensions,feasibility. WiFi is free but only available on the first floor, the lounge (breakfast room) is lovely for this purpose as well as for reading and relaxing. Quite hotel, away from the bustle, but within easy walking distance to main sites. Lovely, would recommend.",

                "content": "We stayed here for two nights on a fourteen-day (seven-hotel) trip. We were very impressed by almost every element of this hotel - its location, design and luxuriousness. But we were extremely put-off by the non-functioning air-conditioning (and, in particular) the staff's (non-)response to it. The hotel is well located - quite close to the station and along the \"main drag\" between there and St Mark's Square. At least one other reviewer has recommended taking the ferry there along the Grand Canal, but we walked. The distance isn't a problem at all, and it's not hard to find, but there _are_ two bridges (with stairs) to cross on the way, so consider that if you're lugging suitcases. It's a very modern and renovated place (in an old building). It's listed as four stars and looks it. Quite luxurious, but small and a bit fancier than we needed. And not \"luxurious\" to us in the ways that we find most important. For example, the shower was tinier than most, and the fittings (though modern) don't work well in it. Breakfast was so-so. Nice to have proper coffee and fancy little jams. But the croissants and eggs were no better than places half this price. The only real inconvenience though was the AC - it didn't run, and we suspect the staff were lying about why. The room was quite warm (with not much of a breeze from the windows), and the air-conditioning either didn't work or wasn't turned on. Friends who'd just visited Venice warned us that might be the case - something about laws about the date they can start activating it...? But they also warned us the hotel would be liable to lie to us about the problem. That's pretty much exactly what happened. There were lots of excuses and no real action to resolve the issue - both signs (in our minds) that we were being lied to. We were able to live with no AC. But being misled really rubbed me the wrong way.",

The hotel is very conveniently located for the vaporetto, being a just a few steps from the nearest stop on the Grand Canal, and it is in walking distance of the railway station. Just around the corner there are some very good restaurants in Santa Croce, and yet its immediate surroundings are quiet and peaceful. The hotel itself is very stylish, an interesting old building decorated in modern style, and our room was large, luxurious and well equipped. All the staff were excellent, friendly and helpful.

                "content": "My first thought about Maui Eldorado is that there must be great inconsistency in the condition of the units. Some of the reviews are fantastic, but our unit was not in good condition. It was actually somewhat disgusting. The entire unit needed painted (about 10 years ago) and baseboard work. We had water damage is both bathrooms and the bedroom. The tubs were missing large sections of porcelain and there were tiles missing and cracked everywhere. Counters were mildewed and missing tiles. Kitchen was just kind of old and yucky. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom was right above the bed and so loud and clanky we turned it off to sleep. Our deadolt didn't work, bathroom sink didn't drain and no lightbulb in outside doorway. On the plus side, the area was fantastic. We had a beautiful, large balcony with a view of the golf course and the ocean. It was amazing to sit out and view the scenery. We loved the cabana and beach area. The pool area was big, but very cold. Overall, we would not stay here again, unless we got one of the great units that other people seem to review favorably. So beware what you may end up with. By the way we were in the building closest to the lobby and room 204.",

We jogged next to the cart path for some exercise over to the village. Parking garage is in the middle, we were in unit I-201, right next to the garage with a partial golf course view, yet it was booked as a 1 bedroom garden view. The unit is huge for what you pay, 2 beds (we only used one), and a big living room area, plus the patio. Only cons I have is there is no work out facility. If you want to work out, you'll have to pay to use a facility. We jogged along the golf course (as many others do), did some pushups, and swam laps in the pool located on top of the garage instead. We also stayed 2 nights at the Kapalua Villas as a splurge and liked Eldorado better. The Villas were fancy smancy, but for the money, we thought the extra space and fancy stuff wasn't necessary. The location of Eldorado makes it the winner. A clean (firm) bed and shower area is what you're looking for in these places. This one had some mildew on the shower head, so do the Villas, but I can over look that and did mention it to the staff and my followup survey. Both beds were clean and firm here. Black Rock is the best snorkel location, and this hotel is right there. Don't worry about the views. Garden view is fine, and your view will be of a golf course no matter what you pick, even if it's a garden view. Some units do see the ocean, but you're gong to see that in person any way. So if you're on a budget and don't care about the view, the garden view is going to work and you'll be surprised.",

Our only complaint is that the hours on the cabanas are only til 5:30. You can easily walk to the beach or whalers village, but if you don't feel like it, there are shuttles available to each.

                "content": "We stayed at the Maui El Dorado for three nights of our nine night Hawaii trip. This condo complex was in a great location and an excellent value. The remainder of our stay was at the Grand Wailea so we were not looking for an ultra luxury location while on Kaanapali. This was our first time to stay at a condo complex and were happy with our decision. The location was easily found by our GPS located in the heart of the Kaanapali Resort area, right near the beach. (There is a section of the golf course between the hotel and beach / cabana) The condo is adjacent to Black Rock and the Sheraton. Self parking is $7, which some people were not happy with but I was pleased that the complex does not have a resort fee, which seems to run rampant in Hawaii. We arrived very late due to flight delays and were greeted by the night security guard Randy was very welcoming and took us to our condo and even assisted with our heavy luggage. (Dive gear). There is a central parking garage that always had plenty of space. The condo we were in for the first night was well appointed but unfortunately the curtains were sheer and did not block out any light. (they should consider making this a standard requirement of all the units) If we wanted to rise early every day it would not have been a problem, but since we were on vacation we wanted to be able to sleep in a bit. We went down to the front desk and she kindly gave us the option of a few more units to check out. We selected J120 which was a direct view of the ocean over the golf course. Very well appointed and comfortable. They even took care of transferring out luggage while we were out. Check in was quick and easy and our luggage arrived in our room promptly. The front desk person even gave us a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. I think that this was great customer service. The units are not ultra plush, maybe a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The complex has at least two pools, nothing spectacular, but nice enough for a quick lounge when you do not want to head to the beach. The beach and private cabana as well as Black Rock (great snorkeling) are about a 7 minute walk from the complex and is a really nice perk. I think that the beach is nicer than that of the Sheraton. The cabana has a nice deck with loungers, towels, seat backs for the beach. Though there are not umbrellas available at the beach, there are many nice trees along the dune line if you are looking for shade. The cabana also has a full stove, refrigerator, and sink area. This is a great touch that allows you to bring your drinks, snacks, lunch, whatever while hanging out at the beach. (The cabana was being remodeled and should be complete by now) Though this condo complex lacks the Disney-esque pools of some of the mega resort hotels, we would come back here in a heart beat. It was very centrally located in the Kaanapali area. You could walk to the shops at Whalers village in about a 12 minute casual stroll and easy to find. (Though if you come back at night it can be hard to find the walkways across the golf course......make sure to pay attention when heading out for the night.) The complex has a small lobby with an activity booking agent and a convenience store. There is a nice casual service restaurant in a shopping center right across the street. The rooms had nicely appointed full kitchens, acceptable bathrooms, washer, dryer, King or Queen bed, Couch, dining table, and balcony with chairs. It seems most of the units had 27\" CRT TV's....I am sure owners will gradually upgrade the TV's. The units have free internet, though it is hard wired and not wifi. (If we were staying for a full week we might consider bringing a cheap wireless router) Housekeeping provided refresh service each day and was very prompt to come to our unit the day that we called for service when we had not yet seen them. All of the staff we ran across during out stay was friendly and willing to help when asked for assistance. We stayed at the Sheraton next door last year and for about twice the price I think we would just come back to the El Dorado....we would rather spend the money on activities and found that the location of the El Dorado is excellent. Though the grounds at the Sheraton were more stellar we felt that the rooms at the El Dorado were just as nicely appointed and it was nice to have the kitchen and laundry facilities. We would definitely stay here again.",

The staff were helpful and friendly, the accommodation is good value and the beach to our mind is one of the best in the world. This is the place to go to relax. The complex is quiet and low key. The pools may be basic but how often can you go to a place and get a whole pool to yourself. The units are spacious and airy, yes they do vary in quality so do your research. The only area of improvement could have been a really thorough cleaning of our unit half way through our stay. As we were there 17 days the bathroom mirrors and sinks could have done with a really thorough clean, same with the kitchen. Having said that I could have asked and I am confident it would have been done, the housekeeping did a great job of keeping us well supplied with towels and amenities. We recommend using the farmers markets for fresh produce and the 'Fish Market' north of the Eldorado in a strip mall just past 'Times\" supermarket. Goofy Foot surf school in Lahainia did a great job getting this family surfing for the first time and we would do it again. The snorkeling at Black Rock closest to the cabana (not the Sheraton side) is good and not crowded, we often saw turtles. Gazebos near Napilli beach is great for breakfast but get there early or you will be waiting a long time. Special thanks to Ruby and MaryAnn who helped with our bookings and were always so kind and helpful. We will undoubtedly be back again. Williams family (Portland OR)",

                "content": "Was pleased with our stay at the Eldorado. As has been pointed out before, there is variability among the units, so some may be better or worse than ours. We reserved a studio via Orbitz which was a good size, approx. 700 sf. Room was clean, furniture and appliances were in decent shape (not new, but not old either). Dishes and utensils were provided and were decent. As for the location, I find the \"15 minute walk to the beach\" claims to be a bit exaggerated. It's more like a 5-minute walk to the beach. It's not any different than walks to the beach from your room at one of the mega-resort type hotels (the ones with lots of buildings, long hallways, waits for elevators, and strategic paths meandering past shops and concessions). The golf course is between the rooms and the ocean, so the walk is not in a straight line, which may make it feel longer, but it is literally 5 minutes max. The beach was nice and pretty open. Great for sitting or laying out, though there is much better snorkeling next door at the Sheraton (which is signed as a public beach). Nobody said anything to us when we brought our Outrigger towels through the Sheraton grounds to the beach to snorkel. It's probably about a 10-minute walk from your Eldorado room to the Sheraton beach. What was annoying was that the Eldorado has a number of nickel-and-dime fees. Fees for making toll-free calls, fees for in-room coffee (first one per stay is free, additional is extra), charges for laundry detergent (again, first bottle per stay is free, additional is extra). There was even a charge to use the safe, and if you declined it, they asked you to sign a release form at checkin. This doesn't exactly give the visitor a warm-and-fuzzy on arrival. If it were up to me, I'd rather they comp the coffee and safe, and charge for detergent. That would bring them in line with normal hotel standards. The Internet was free, though, which was nice (and fast). It is with a cable, though, not wifi. There's a Safeway and Longs in town, just a few miles down the street to pick up anything you need, along with several dining options. Overall, we were pleased with the value for the money and would definitely stay here again.",

We had a 1 bedroom partial ocean view unit that had recently been upgraded, full tile floor, big furnished lanai and everything we needed to feel at home for a few days. The garage parking seemed safe and secure, but the one caution would be this property did not seem handicap friendly (access to most units involved steps or a steep walkway up or down). I had worried about traffic noise as the complex is just downhill from the highway but it was quiet, quiet, quiet! We used the pool deck grills 2 nights and had the whole area and it's ocean view to ourselves. It was an easy walk down to the beach or shopping and restaurants at Whaler's Village, and next door to Round Table Pizza and C'J's Deli for quick meals.",

Its a short walk to the Whaler's Village Complex and there's a free shuttle we used everyday to haul our \"gifts\" back to our unit. I had no problem with parking and asked for the local papers delivered each morning. No problem. House keeping did a fine job and very friendly. As for the BBQ's, our unit, J210 (studio) had its own and we used it every other night. Check in/out was quick and painless. There is a small convience store next to the lobby which we found priced a little more than the Safeway (5 minutes away) but great for the forgotten bottle of wine or sixpack or whatever. Our unit, J210 was great! Really nice walk-in shower with optional overhead shower head. Free wireless. comfy bed. A/C which we didn't need. All-in-all. Great time was had.

Not sure what was so hard about comprehending that but we didn't get a door to the bedroom so we listened to our twin 1 year old boys scream themselves to sleep. Good times. The pools are ok - not very busy. The beach is great when there's no torrential rain storms going on. Whaler's Village is close enough to walk to, which is nice and Lahaina is a quick drive.

It was 3 adults- and we booked a 1 bedroom garden view condo- well, as I read on this site before we went, all the condos are individually owned, and therefore are all a little different. The first one they put us in was pretty bad, the decor was tired and dirty, but the biggest surpise was that while they called it a \"1 bedroom condo\" - it was really more of large room with a partial length wall between the beds and living room area, but no real separation or privacy of the sleeping and living/cooking area. I consider that a studio, and I did see several of these condos. Not what I had in mind at all when booking a \"1 bedroom condo\" for 1 couple and one single adult traveler!! After looking at 4 available rooms, we ended up in a great 1 bedroom partial ocean view condo in with a fully separate bedroom with 2 queen beds, a fold out couch in the living room, and 2 full bathrooms which was a real bonus. Kitchen was small but clean and up to date, and this room was just behind the lobby area so great for parking up front. We were in K204, great ocean view, nice big balcony- and we also saw and liked K104 which had the same layout. This hotel has a great beach which was never crowded, is a 5 min walk to the shops and restaurants in Whalers Village. Main pool was also quiet and had nice BBQ's there as well. If you are shopping for food, I thought the \"STAR MARKET\" just up the road towards Kapalua about 5 min was much better quality and stocked than the Safeway down the road to Lahaina. We got the best fresh local mahi mahi there and that on the BBQ as you watch the sunset from your balcony is pretty great! We ate out at SANSEI in Kapalua for sushi and it was quite good. This is a great condo style set up for familys or couples, and its so nice to be away from the crowds at all the hotels and condos along the beach by whalers village which gets pretty packed, and that is not my idea of relaxing! One last thing, if you are heading over soon, do find a whale watching trip, we did and it was a great experience! I will go back to this hotel for sure!",

The condo they put us in was not partial oceanview but it was a 2 bedroom and seemed to be larger then our own house back home. We found out the next day that that was the only condo available when we checked in and needed to move as the owners were coming to stay. The entire staff was very apologetic and accomodating. The next day when we returned to the condo we found a large gift basket waiting for us and a card from the manager. The hotel overall had beautiful grounds and we loved the tiled pool.

We have stayed at Outrigger properties before on Kauai so we were extremely dissapointed when we went home. The decor was outdated in the room. The main pool above the parking garage was just a cement pond with water with absolutely no Hawaiian charms at all. In a previous post I agree with the person who said the bathrooms were dark and old. We stayed in G building. On the 3rd night there I heard rumbling in our kitchen. Somebody had eaten thru a plastic bag of food. Well when we mentioned that there was a 3rd party in our room and by the bite marks it was very large they said they couldn't move us for a day and not even a sense of \"we are sorry.\" When they did get us a new room they wouldn't even help us move to K building which wasn't close. I even got some snide comments from the staff \"Oh you are the one with the rodent\" and then a chuckle. The manager admitted to me that they knew of a problem in Building G that is why they had an exterminator there the day I found our roommate. They offered to move us to building H but I refused considering it was fumigate the first 2 days of our stay.

The location of this hotel is great...right smack in the middle of old town city and lots of resturants along the street. My only dissapointment would be that while it has the stated facilities, it is not as just not as Grand and Premier as one would expect of a typical 5 star hotel , but to be fair to the hotel, I read that the '5 star standard' in Istanbul varies from elsewhere. Don't expect a typical 5 star style Suite and Spa Hotel. I would give it 3.5 - 4 stars with great location and very helpful staff so if you consider this as a 3.5 - 4 star hotel when booking and you are happy with the room rates, then you certainly won't be dissapointed.",

                "content": "We just returned from a wonderful 10-day trip to Turkey, and stayed at some wonderful hotels everywhere. But the best hotel for us was the Best Western Premier Regency Suites, and that's high praise since we really enjoyed the other hotels we stayed at. We stayed here for 4 nights. The location is fabulous - it's on Akbiyik Caddesi, which is a street full of cafes, lovely restaurants offering street-side tables in summer, and boutique hotels. It's a five minute walk to Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque, seven minutes to the Topkapi Saray, and just round the corner from the Arasta Bazar, which is a smaller, less frenzied, and less confusing version of the Grand Bazar, and no pressure from any of the shopkeepers. The waterfront is five minutes away by cab, and Taksim about 20 minutes away. The hotel is small - 16 rooms - but has all the conveniences you would expect, like an elevator, ground floor restaurant serving meals all day long, and even its own hammam and spa! The rooms are great - we had three rooms (401, 403 and 404) on the fourth floor - and are huge, particularly by Istanbul standards. The fittings and furnishings are of very high quality - super comfortable beds, sofas and sitting area, two desks, LCD TV mounted on the wall, room safe, minibar, etc. Perfect to come home to after a long day's sightseeing! Free wi-fi was a bonus, also there is a laptop guests can use, plus a printer downstairs. There's a beautiful rooftop on the fifth floor with views of the Marmara Sea on one side and the Blue Mosque on the other. By the way, some other reviewers had commented on the noise from the call to prayer. Our rooms faced the street, and we had no noise issues at all - the windows are double glazed, and the most we heard was a light murmur one night. Considering it's such a lively street, it was amazingly quiet. The hotel staff was so kind and caring - any requests we had were attended to promptly. The girl at the front desk even told us not to exchange money at the hotel as we could get a better rate outside! Whenever we took a taxi, they would come outside and give the address to the driver in Turkish, and one time when we were taking a cab back to the hotel and the driver was trying to overcharge us when we reached, she actually came outside and yelled at him, and voila! that was the end of his overcharging attempts! Breakfast every day was very good - huge selection of fruits, yogurt, cheeses and eggs cooked to order. Overall, we felt it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at, and can highly recommend it. We are planning to return to Turkey next year, and will stay here again for sure. For large, well appointed rooms, personalized service and great location, you can't do any better!",

All the units are very comfortable providing for very good sleep, and of course very clean. We particularly like the heated bathroom floors! Very nice restaurant too--great breakfast with lots of choices. We needed to keep exercising and it offers a very nice gym with modern machines that you can access at any time.

The room was spottlesly clean and had extra beds for both our children and the location is perfect for visiting the main sights of Istanbul. However, a couple of warnings. First, a suite in Turkey doesn't mean multiple rooms, merely a single bedroom with ensuite bathroom. Secondly, the deluxe suites (I don't think they have a standard class, the alternative is an executive suite) offer a view of a brick wall just over a metre from the windows. Not that we were there to sit looking out the window, but you couldn't even tell if it was cloudy or sunny without craning your neck out the window. Warning's out the way, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel - just be aware what you're booking.",

                "content": "A hotel suite is normally means a connected series of rooms to be used together and not a single room as was provided. I booked what was described as Suite Executive Room and expected what I would normally get from a suite: a separate bedroom and other living area. I wanted a larger room because I was staying 8 days. I got s single room - clearly not a suite - at what was really an outrageous price. This really is misleading advertising and not acceptable. The street where the hotel is located has many other hotels and hostels as well as bars and restaurants. It is fairly downmarket with any walk down the street resulting in being accosted by touts for each. The hotel has a basic restaurant serving uninspiring food. The breakfast buffet is limited and poor. There is a very small range of breakfast cereals and fruit and some poor cold meat products that are really only suitable for feeding to the many cats in the area. There is a top floor open-air balcony but, unlike other hotels, this has no awnings or canopies and so is quite unusable in the hot afternoons. There is a separate smaller balcony area off the fourth floor but this is unfinished. There was building work and associated noise that went on until around 8:00 pm some days but this was not mentioned anywhere on the hotelâ€™s Web site. And on a final note; rooms were typically not made-up until after 4;00 pm. When we arrived back one day after 4:00 pm we were told our room was not cleaned and were offered a drink while we waited. These drinks appeared on our bill at check-out. I have to say that my experience with this hotel is so completely at odds with that of others that I feel something is fundamentally wrong. I selected the hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews and, based on this experience, have a significantly reduced trust in reviews on this site. The very poor value for money and overall experience invalidates any minor saving graces such as cleanliness.",

The second room had more space and a larger bathroom too. Nice breakfast, excellent coffee and very friendly staff. The only thing we noticed was the noise level in the breakfast room by the staff clearing away crockery. Other than this, it is an ideally located hotel and very good value for money. I was impressed by the internet service available and the loan of a notebook for our use in the room. I would recommend this hotel and would use it again when we next visit the very beautiful city of Rome.",

The room was recently (and quite lavishly) refurbished and quite spacious (even with an additional bed for our 14 year old son). The bathroom was huge. There was free wireless internet access from the room, The hotel seems to be a smaller off shoot from a nearby hotel and so there aren't a lot of staff. But those that there are, were friendly and very helpful. The manager Reza seemed to be everywhere and very willing to help. When my wife enquired about a coffee shop when we first arrived after a long flight - Reza was back with a cappuccino almost immediately. Breakfast was basic but more than adequate. The hotel is centrally located near to the main railway station - but off a quiet street. And the cost was very reasonable compared with other places we stayed in Italy. We would definitely stay there again.",

Tourgay and his staff truly bend over backwards to ensure that your stay is comfortable. The property has no evelator but is only 3 stories in height - even though I travelled with school aged children this was not an issue. The hotel staff were very helpful in unloading and loading baggage from our vehicle. The rooms were very clean, hot water was plentiful and the kitchenette was well stocked with all the essential for food preparation. There is a 24 hour grocery store right next door and the metro is about a 5 minute walk away. Very close to McGill and would be an excellent base for anyone moving a student to that instituation in the city. We stayed in a room with a king bed and pullout queen sofabed. The queen sofabed was suprisingly comfortable as these types of sleeping arrangements can be touch and go depending on the hotel. Also included were 2 plasma TV's and free parking through a little laneway behind the hotel. The hotel is an excellent value when used as a home away from home. I would stay here again without question.",

Breakfast was good and they went out of their way to make sure everyone was finished and had all they needed before closing up the breakfast area. The room was clean and comfortable. There was a little wear showing in the bathroom but nothing unacceptable. The pool was warm but only 3 1/2 feet deep. They had a hot tub and a workout room. The location was good but a little bit hard to find if you didn't have a printed map with directions. With the directions we had no problems finding it. You had to wind through a residential area and appartment complexes. It was right near the Gallaria mall and close to the freeway. One evening my two children and I arrived back at the hotel probably about 11:30pm and we were approached in the parking lot by a nicely dressed man saying he and his wife were stranded back on the highway and his family was in Ohio and they needed money to stay in a neighboring hotel. They were short $16.00 and could I help them out. I gave him $20.00 and hurried into the hotel. Legitimate? who knows, well probably not but I figured 20.00 was worth there being no scene or other problems with my kids there. I didn't really feel unsafe and the parking lot was very well lit. This hotel is directly next to an Embassy Suites and a Motel 6 so there are other hotels in the area. We would probably stay here again but I would be ready to get inside the building right away after parking!",

                "content": "My husband and I just spent 4 nights at this hotel and overall we were very disappointed. Mostly from two things - our air conditioner was SOOO loud, it sounded like an airplane engine. We were going to change rooms but figured they would probably all be that loud. Not only was it loud but also rattled - so annoying. But that wasn't the worst part, we got up on our second morning and walked to our car and see some people standing around their car and they asked if our car was ok because their truck's passenger window had been smashed out and items were stolen. Luckily our car was fine but we felt really bad for them. Then the hotel never cleaned up the glass, it was still there when we left this morning! The location of the hotel is not great. It is confusing to find, confusing to get on I-75N from, and there is a sketchy apartment complex right behind it with some creepy/sketchy people walking through the parking lot at all hours. No wonder you have to use your key card to access the front lobby after 9pm! The only good thing about the place, the price and the room layout. You have a separate living room area and separate bedroom area. Too bad the air conditioning is only in the bedroom area so that made it difficult for the living room to get cool enough. Oh, one last thing, you should bring an eye mask if you want to sleep in, the windows didn't have heavy curtains to keep the room dark. Only sheer curtains, I couldn't believe it. Anyway, I hope this helps you decide if you want to stay here or not. I would personally suggest staying a little more north - like at the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Select (along 75 in Richardson).",

                "content": "Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating, though most of the housekeeping staff does not speak English. Room was clean except for one spot on the bedspread but I never use hotel bedspreads anyway, so it wasn't a big deal for me. Everything else was fresh and clean. Entire hotel is non-smoking which is a major plus for me. Pets are allowed with a deposit but if people actually take their pets there, you'd never know it. There was no smell at all nor did I have any issues with allergies from pet dander. Beds and pillows were VERY comfortable. Rooms and hallways were very quiet. We never heard our neighbors or any outside noise at all. Windows do open but it was too warm for us to take advantage of that. When we checked in the AC had already been turned on for us so the room was nice and cool - perfect after such a long drive. Hot tub and pool area were very clean and no too many people used them. However, the chlorine smell was VERY strong and caused some eye and allergy irritation for some of us - even those who didn't get into the water. We were able to prop open the emergency exit door to the outside and it got a little better. Room has a fairly low ceiling so if they used better ventilation or had a higher glass ceiling, it might not be so bad. Also, there is a lot of echo in that room - more than you'd think - and it's hard to carry on a conversation, even in the hot tub. Continenal breakfast included make-your-own-waffles and the waffle iron was shaped like Texas, which everyone thought was cool. Also had a limited selection of bagels, english muffins, bread for toast. Bananas and apples were the fruit choices. Small boxes of Kelloggs cereals available. Also had sausage biscuits, breakfast burritos and sausage/pancake corndogs that could be microwaved. No microwave in the rooms but the breakfast room was open 24 hours so you could use that if needed. Several restaurants and fast food places close by. Also not far from both Kroger and Walmart Supercenter. Overall, not a place I'd go if I was looking for a vacation where you relax at the hotel- rooms are fairly small but adequate for sleeping. Double queen room does not have enough room for an added rollaway, for example. But for an on-the-go vacation where all you need is a clean comfy place to sleep, a decent breakfast and that's convenient to everything, this is a great choice.",

The fitness center was a big plus too. The only downside I'd give to the hotel is that the walls are kind of thin and you can hear everything in the hallway and that the internet was a little slow.

We were actually kind of excited about this hotel because it was such a great deal and being a Hyatt we were expecting great quality and service. After the 4+ hour drive we check in and get into our rooms, ready to wash off a bit and realize that the water coming out of the faucets is a dark brown color and smells of sewage. I was mortified. We checked both sinks and the shower and actually got video footage. Then we called the front desk and asked if they were aware of any problems expecting them to be apologetic and maybe even having us move to another hotel. No reaction. They said they'd send someone up to our room. No one ever came so I went downstairs to try to find some potable water. When I turned on the faucet in the ladies down stairs-- same thing! Disgusting. I asked the front desk person if they knew of any plumbing problems and she said no but called her manager. When she was finally able to track someone down by phone he said that yes by the way they had shut the water off earlier in the day and this happens. We should let the water run a while and it should be fine. We never received an apology. No one ever checked up on us to find out if the situation had been resolved. Nothing. Very, very disappointed. And disgusted. How does this happen? Really?",

The problem was fixed very quickly.The room was clean although in no way shape or form a suite in my opinion. There is a wall that separates the bedroom from the sitting area and I found the room the smallest suite I've ever seen. The kitchen is functional with small fridge, microwave, and stove. However, the problem is insulation. We heard every noise going on outside from the construction, the people upstairs, the people walking by outside in the hallways. There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing! The breakfast buffet was decent as long as you don't mind warming it up. There are very few restaurants nearby and the staff is not very knowledgable. I would not return but may be economical choice for business travelers",

This time I had the worst room I've ever had. It had one tiny window that overlooked the construction site (the hotel is expanding and the new part is scheduled for completion next spring). The window was tiny and dirty so the room seemed claustrophobic. It only had a double bed. There was no closet, just a wardrobe that was not large enough to hold a week's worth of business clothes. But the hotel is clean, pretty quiet, and the employees are, to a person, pleasant and accomodating. The restaurant, Social, is good but probably not worth the prices!",

The Seinfield Episode where Kramer has illegal shower heads comes to mind because it is easy to want to stay in the shower for long periods of time (just don't wash the produce off in the shower)! The Aveda amenties are superior to those that you would find in typical chain hotels. Although the Lumen is not on par with the other Kimpton Hotel nearby, it is a very good value and has a great location and service.",

For some reason, they don't close the doors to the management offices. Also, be aware that their restaurant doesn't open for lunch, so you have to grab something elsewhere for lunch. It is a pet friendly hotel, and they have a lovely dog that greets guests at the front desk...but be warned if you have pet allergies.

I found WorldQuest online by doing a little research and was so glad we switched. First of all, the facility is beautiful and the pool was a huge highlight for our boys. Staff was very pleasant and check-in and out was a breeze. We stayed in a 3 bedroom unit which suited all of our needs and having the kitchen and our own separate bathrooms was a joy! Very quiet facility. Nice to not hear the noise from the other rooms and nice to be away from the crowds of people after a full day at disney. The shuttle service was superb and free! Insiders tip - we had an amazing taxi driver on the days we did not take the shuttle. His name is Van{not sure how to spell it} and he drives a van! He was one of the highlights of our trip. He was a super driver and took such good care of us. Drove us out to the Space Center{45 minute drive each way} and was there promptly to pick us up. Took us to a great restaurant for dinner{Golden Corral} great food and cheap! He is such a nice, hard working man. Taxi drivers must pay to lease their vehicles and he pays $1500.00 per week for his van. Gas not included. He works over 18 hours a day. So if you are going to Orlando, please request him. He is a sweetheart!!!",

Felt as if you were in an apartment or condo 4. The kitchen was well stocked if you had a desire to cook or have meals without going out. 5. The pool area was nice. 6. A gated property where your parking tag as displayed to enter and exit the facility 7. Breakfast was provided. 8. Excellent proximity to the parks 9. A safe for valuables. 10. Screened in patio that allowed our granddaughter to be outside without the fear of her falling over. Cons: 1. I requested an early check-in. I called upon landing at 10:30 and was told to call again at 2:00. I arrived at the property at 3:00 and waited in a rather small lobby with several other disgruntled families waiting for their room. Was not assigned a room until closer to 4:00. There was only one person checking in a line of people. When he asked the person behind me to go to the next window I informed him I was already told by her that she was \"busy.\" 2. I asked to be in a building near the front of the property since my husband has a health condition and I am always concerned about an ambulance. We were placed in Building 6 near the back of the property. 3. We had a two bedroom unit. The toilet in one of the bathrooms did not work properly, and the other bathroom's toilet had a broken handle. I called, but they were never fixed properly. 4. One evening we came back rather late to find our door \"unlocked.\" Our three year old granddaughter pulled on the handle before we inserted the key and it just opened. 5. I called about the lock but nobody showed up when we asked. The next day we called again and I was told they would send someone \"right out.\" After waiting we left with the hope that our belongings would not be disturbed we left for the park as nobody arrived. 6. The day of check out, we were awakened at 9:20 to make sure we were leaving. At 10:50, another knock on the door asking if we were leaving. I said yes, within 30 minutes. I asked if I had to check out and she said \"no, just leave the key cards.\" While waiting for my daughter to finish, I stripped the sheets from the bed, vacuumed the carpet, swept the kitchen floor, my husband emptied the trash, placed the towels in one area, etc. and took our bags to the van. At 11:20 the phone rang and a woman â€œcheck-out time is at 11:00.â€� By then, I was livid. I proceeded to tell her I was aware of the time and she was the THIRD person who asked when we were leaving and rattled off the requests that I had and were not fulfilled. I also told her I began cleaning the room while waiting to leave. She told me â€œquit taking it personally.â€� I replied I am not taking it personally but I am insulted that this is the third notice for a twenty minute delay. Two of the notices began prior to the check-out time, I said when I get home; I will post how I was treated on Trip Advisor. Her response was â€œdo what you have to do.â€� She was unapologetic the entire time. She also asked how she is supposed to know that I had been contacted twice before, I suggested they improve their communication system.",

                "content": "We stayed here in December 2011 based on a recommendation from a friend. I had asked (via Facebook) for any recommendations for a condo to stay while in the Disney area. We were traveling with our two young children, my mother, and my sister, and thought a condo would be a better option than the two hotel rooms we had booked nearby. After speaking to my friend and thoroughly researching the property here in tripadvisor, we decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did - we stayed three nights in a three bedroom in Building 3 and were very comfortable. We had a couple of minor issues - the kitchen sink was emitting a strange smell and there were some items under beds and the couch that likely could have been cleaned up with a more thorough cleaning crew. We didn't make a big deal of the sink since we were rarely at the condo, though I am sure they would have at least checked it out if we had called it in. We just returned from a second three night stay yesterday and again had a very pleasant experience. This time it was just us and the kids, though we did have a three bedroom again (Building 2 this time, on a high floor - nice view) because it was a last minute trip and evidently the two bedrooms are booked early. No matter, the nightly rate was still more reasonable than just ONE room at any of the hotels (at least any that we would want to stay at) nearby and we saved money just by having a kitchen and washer/dryer. Additionally, our sanity was saved thanks to our kids being able to have a separate room. I noticed a similar cleanliness issue on this trip - trash was found under one of the beds that really should not have been there - makes you wonder what else is missed. Additionally, the bathrooms seem to be showing some wear and tear and could have used a good caulking - but this is typical for the humidity of Florida (we live in the state as well and have similar issues in our bathrooms). We did not take advantage of the pool on either trip, but it looks like a great place to have some fun. We also did not do breakfast - I have seen a lot of people complaining about the lack of variety, but this is a continental breakfast that is included in the room rate, I don't see why that warrants a complaint. It is just as easy to drive to the Publix that is five minutes away and get some healthier options and eat in your own condo, on your own time, without being crowded. Additionally, after reading the negative reviews on the park shuttles, we opted to drive ourselves to the theme parks and felt that this really was the way to go. Bottom line is that this is a very affordable place to stay, generally clean, and extremely convenient to the parks, without making you a slave to the Disney property. We will never stay anywhere else when we go to Disney.",

The 2-bedroom condo we stayed in was comfortable, beautiful and well priced. The staff accomodated our request for and adjacent 3-bedrm condo so the entire family could be close. It really was a home away from home. An initial stop and the 24-hour Super Walmart down the street allowed us to stock the Kitchen for quick meals that saved us a bundle from needing to purchase park food. A 10-min drive to the Magic Kingdom parking lot gave us the ability to leave a cooler in the car, which saved us a bundle on purchasing park food. Only negative comment I can make was that the water pressure in the shower was a little weak. Nothing that I couldn't live with though.",

Although you are only about 3 minutes away from Disney, this place is very isolated. There was a lake in the back of the building 7 with warning signs about alligators.

We are Disney fanatics but it is difficult for my mother to walk from our hotel room to the transportantion when staying on Disney property. THis is why I thought to try something new. I can say we were extremely impressed. We walked a short walk to the elevator. The room was beautiful and up to date. It was a 10 minute drive to the parks. The three bedroom suite was so beautiful. I loved having 3 bathrooms. I was able to purchase my park tickets there so another convience!!! THe only thing I did not like was that there wasn't a kiddie pool at the time, especially because we had 3 under 6 but oh well. We are leaving for Disney soon and I have to break it to the family that we are not staying there. They are not going to be happy.

Our boys (ages 3 and 1) loved the jacuzzi tub the most. The resort was beautiful, the pool was refreshing, and the continental breakfast was a nice way to start each day. We were impressed with how friendly and helpful the front desk staff members were, greeting us each day and taking the time to talk to our boys. The daily housekeeping service was delightful - loved not having to do dishes while we were on vacation! The location was perfect - close and convenient to Disney, as well as area eateries, yet once we drove through the gates, we felt like we left everything behind us. The only downside we could find was the free resort shuttle to Disney, as it offered limited pick up and drop off times that did not coincide with our boys' nap schedule. While we ended up driving to Disney each day, it was a very easy drive and truly wasn't a big problem for us. Driving allowed us to come and go as we pleased, which in the end worked out better. Overall we were very impressed with WorldQuest, and highly recommend it! We will be back!",

I read many of the reviews on trip advisor and some of them made me nervous before the trip. I am happy to say that all my fear was gone 15min after arrival! Absolutletly outstanding!! We stayed in building 1 in a 3 bedroom suite, and let me tell you it has all the room you need. We have stayed in Disney before and this was our first experience outside the park...Completely worth it, especially when you have a larger group so you don't have to be sitting on top of each other like in the disney resort....and for half the cost. The staff was very friendly and happy to help us anytime we needed anything. We opted to decline the daily room service...we were perfectly capable of washing our own towels and keeping it tidy. The pool was beautiful and never overcrowded..great music playing all day long. We stayed on the ground level and you would think there would be some noise...nope! very quiet. Something you definetly want to have is a car. Super Walmart is a couple of miles away and you can stock up on food (there is no restaurant at the resort) and supplies. All the Disney hot spots are literally only 5-10min drives from the resort (the resort does have shuttles but we loved the flexibility of coming and going as we pleased). The complimentary breakfast was nice so you could get up and get a quick bite and be on your way. I would also suggest you stay in building 1,2,or 3 just because they are closest to the pool. I have nothing but good things to say about this resort and while everyone is entitled to their own opinion I found some of the negative and pretentious ones on trip advisor to be unfounded. Bottom line is we loved it and would stay there again!!",

I would not have wanted to pay more than I did but would recommend if you can get this price or less. Good fitness centre and pool. We asked for and were given connecting rooms as we were travelling with our teenage children. I think this is now a slightly older hotel so choose a high floor away from the elevator in order to get some quiet, you can hear people in the next room although we were not really disturbed.",

                "content": "From beginning to end, our stay in this hotel was abysmal. I was here for a conference the last week in June, and didn't have a say on where to stay, and was concerned about the reviews I read, but was hoping it was better than others thought. The most negative of the reviews were right on!! The first night, the a/c in the room was non-existent, and the room would not cool off. We called several times, and they told us to radically lower the thermostat, which had no real effect. We then asked to have a fan sent up, which they did after some time. We then asked the next night to have a different room, which was somewhat better, but we luckily kept the fan, or it wouldn't have been usable. The minibar in both rooms was set up so that you couldn't use it to store other cold items without being charged $25.00; even Red Roof Inn have usable mini refrigerators in their rooms! The problems continued - the conference I attended ran out of coffee after 1/2 hour, and the hotel, claiming to take care of this, did nothing until the 2nd day, at which time they still provided inadequate coffee. The hotel staff, other than one young man, were surly and ineffectual. To top things off, in the new room my wife opened the nightstand and found that someone had left a sexual device there! I couldn't make this stuff up! The cleaning staff obviously didn't do their job. We returned the sexual device to the front desk, and didn't receive any formal apology about this. Then after the second night, the comforter that was on the bed was taken, and when the room was made up, the comforter was never returned! 7 phone calls later, on the 4th day we were there, they finally brought a comforter, but it was a full size (the bed was a King), and it was wet! We returned that. For our hassles, the hotel did provide us a free dinner, but the restaurant had horrible service on the terrace, and the young waitstaff acted as though they had never waited on any customer before. I should also mention that the rooms were small. The pool was not handicap accessible, there were two staircases of 10 stairs each leading down to it, in a very inaccessible spot. There were no soda or snack machines anywhere on any floor. They charged 50 cents a minute for computer access in their \"business\" center. Once people found that out, they didn't use it, and it was empty, although the hotel employed a person to sit there and provide service (mostly fielding angry comments about the cost). They charged $ per day for wireless internet access, which is incredibly cheap. On check out, there were hassles with the hotel charging me several Massachusetts taxes, even though I had documentation that because it was a Federally Funded Conference I should not be charged state lodging taxes. Other people at the convention I attended had the same problem. The quality control at this Hyatt is obviously very subpar.",

Right by South Station for easy access to the airport or amtrak and right by the subway as well as in the heart of downtown boston so many things are within walking distance. Our room was very nice and spacious, I don't know how we lucked out, but they put us on the top floor in a corner room. The front desk staff as well as the concierage were all very friendly. We booked a decent deal on this room, would not have wanted to pay full price..but all decent rooms in downtown Boston are overpriced. I can't figure out why hotels don't all offer free wi-fi anymore..just seems like another way to nickel and dime customers especially when this hotel didn't come with any other perks like a free breakfast or even a reasonably priced breakfast ($20 for the buffet!). However, the pool and fitness center did help make up for this, both very nice, but the indoor pool was very cold and no hot tub..but the steam room was nice! But, I would definitely stay here again for the location, quality of the rooms and the staff. Thank you!",

                "content": "I arrived early and they were kind enough to get me a room right away. May have been the luck of the draw - but kind. I had asked for a room with two double beds - as I had 3 days of business and then a friend was joining me. I was on the 7th floor - 2 floors above the lobby. At first I was disappointed being on a lower floor - but it worked. I would avoid the 6th floor only because the gym is on that floor and it is open extended hours - which may lead to more noise in the hallway. Speaking of the gym...the workout is getting there - LOL but really it is a great gym with a pool, state of the art gym equipment, steam rooms and really clean. The only misses were the housekeeping staff - they clearly do not read english - which I have no problem with - but they need to speak with their supervisor if they cannot read the note (and tip) I left. I wanted my window left cracked (it was closed) and I had asked for extra Decaf coffee. Also, I had requested turn down service each night - and it was only done 1 night. When I called - they were prompt to send someone quickly - and the turndown staff does a great job of refreshing the room and bathroom. Overall the hotel is in a GREAT location - centrally located - a quick walk from the T (several different T stations - Downtown Crossing, South Station, Chinatown and several others). Very close to Chinatown - attached to a Macys, near many theaters and near the Boston Commons. A couple of quick tips - great and inexpensive lobster at Peach Farm - Chinatown - close to a CVS and the concierge had great restaurant suggestions. I did eat at the Avenue one - the restaurant - the food was very good (lunch) and reasonably priced. I did drink in the bar and wish the red wine choices were more varied. Oh, and one more note: the weekdays the clientele was strickly business - the weekend is a WHOLE different (and louder) crowd - be forewarned",

The inside of the hotel is nice enough, although weirdly laid out. The lobby is on the 3rd floor, and you have to take an elevator from the street level to get to it. This wouldn't be so strange, except for the fact that the elevators to the rooms are on the other side of the lobby. If the elevators were all the same, it would be fine. The rooms were nice, pretty large for downtown, and had great views. I could see the state house clearly from my room. The bed was crazy comfortable, I think it was a featherbed. I just wanted to sleep all day. The only problem with the rooms, and this is a big one, is that the walls are VERY thin. We could hear our neighbors talking, watching tv, even coughing in their room. Which made me wonder what they could hear from our room. Definitely a big minus.",

                "content": "After securing this room on priceline, i was a bit nervous after reading some of the TA reviews! However, we had NO problems at the Hyatt! First of all, there is an elevator that takes you from the street level to the lobby. Then another elevator that takes you up to the rooms. Some people were complaining about this feature, but this is becoming more and more common in larger hotels. It also adds an element of security to your stay. One evening as we were walking from the main elevator to the guest elevator, a stationed Hyatt employee stopped us, and asked to see our room card before boarding the guest elevator. A comforting touch nonetheless. Check in was a breeze. Got the room we requested, and everything was smooth. Julia at the desk was extremely nice and courteous. When we got up to the room (10th floor), the room halls were very cool. Its interesting how they designed it. Blocks of 4 or 5 floors are kind of exposed.. you can look up once you get off the elevator and see the other floors (or down). it has a eurpoean/bavarian forest type of feel in a way! it was kind cool, and unexpected. The room was very clean. The bed was VERY soft. the LCD tv was brand new. the view was even decent. we self parked ourselves... (i believe this was $32 for the single weekend day/night we stayed for). From what i read on the website, i think valet at the hotel, was $42. the parking garage is extremely convenient. at about midnight we ventured to the bar at the hotel.. not a seat remaining. There are tables that are seat yourself to the right of the bar, that are staffed by waiters. we sat and looked at a menu for a late snakc as we just had gotten back from fenway, and decided the late night menu wasnt exactly what we were looking for. Not to mention in the 10 minutes we were there, no one approached us. So we went to Dylan and Max's... about 3-4 minutes down the street. cool, low key bar. Great bar food! The location of the hyatt is interesting. It's suprisingly convenient. The T is really close. The Common is a block away. You are just a block or two from Chinatown section, and you are 'in' the financial district. In my opinion, this isnt really the financial district. We usually stay at Club Quarters. IMO, THAT is the financial district. The Hyatt is more on the fringe i would say. it took about 10-12 minutes to get to fanuiel hall, etc. not too bad. There are stores very close by (dunkin donuts, cvs, tons of retail). I must add that they were SOLD OUT (overbooked actually) the night we stayed... And we had no service issues, nor did we hear anyone else through the walls, floors, ceilings, etc. we had no complaints! The Hyatt's reputation here MAY BE what's hurting it the most. The hyatt is known for its plush accomodations and catering to the higher end. Im thinking this could be it's downfall on the review boards in many instances. We rated the hyatt as very comparable to the other 3.5 to 4 star hotels we have stayed at in Boston and NYC... Clean. Comfy, and conveneint. We really saw no issues!",

I opted to stay at a hotel as, when booking through Travelocity, the cost of some of the flights to Boston from DC was the same as the flight and a few nights hotel stay as I was only there for 2 nights. That being said, I was already family with the area. One of the first things I noticed and really appreciated was the travel sized toothpaste that was in the bathroom. Sure, this is small detail but most places just seem to give you shampoo, lotion and soap and I had forgotten toothpaste so this was a nice convenience. I was also able to check in a few hours early which was nice since the trip was so short. The bed was nice and comfortable. I could have sleep forever but this did not happen as it seemed every morning nearby rooms were being vacuumed before/right around 9am. The AC rattled a lot and the pipes were noisy when the shower was going in neighboring rooms but other than that, the room was very quiet at night. I had a few drinks one night at the restaurant in the hotel as it was a Sunday night and no other restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel was going to stay open as late. The lobby area is weird but not that inconvenient as its just two elevators to get to your room not too sets of stairs. The area is right in the Downtown Crossing/Theater District area so you will see interesting characters if you return to your hotel late at night but I never felt unsafe and knew before hand that the area is not the worst area that a young female could find herself in. The location actually worked quite well as it won't take you long to get to the airport, shopping, Faneuil Hall, Cambridge and any other popular touristy spot.",

                "content": "We stayed here for 5 nights having booked the hotel as part of a package through British Airways. The price was a major influence in our selection, it was the cheapest central hotel they offered. It was only after that we read more of the reviews and began to get worried. We took a taxi from the airport and the doorman offered to help us with the bags on arrival but we declined. The entrance is strange, the lobby is on the third floor so you need to take a lift (there are 3) from the ground. However, to get to these from the street entrance you need to go down a small flight of stairs which was a pain with the luggage (we wished we had used the bellboy)! Also these doors don't really open properly, they are stuck open at an angle which you can walk through without luggage. If the doorman is there they manage to force them open. Check in was a breeze there was no queue and the agent Rosario, was so helpful making sure that our requests had been fulfilled and offering further help and information. It was then, however, we found out that the pool was shut for renovations which had overrun. This was disappointing for us as we do like to chill in the pool normally. However, Rosario explained they had an agreement with the Langham should we wish to use a pool although as it happened, Boston kept us so occupied we didn't have time. We were on the 19th floor which pleased us and there were four lifts, which although were a bit creaky, were always working and we never had a situation where we had a long wait. The room was very spacious and clean and well maintained. It was, however, a little dated and this is reflected throughout the hotel but not to any extent that disappointed us. We had absolutely no issues with noise at all. Every member of staff we met was always friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even after we had checked out the staff on the front desk were more than happy to give us a key to use the sauna and fitness suite so we could shower before our flight home. We found the location to be ideal. It is on top of Downtown Crossing subway station and Boylston was only a couple of minutes walk too. So many of the attractions were such a short distance anyway that sometimes it was just quicker just to walk. There is also an alternate entrance through Macy's (an alternate set of 3 lifts take you down to there). All in all we had a very good time in Boston and was very pleased with the Hyatt as a choice of hotel.",

The location was superb, as its fairly quiet around the property but its still 3 minutes from all the action. State in one direction, Boston Common in the other. Both Downtown Crossing and Chinatown `T` stops are less than 5 minutes away. The staff were also very helpful and in good spirits, and in the room the view over the common to the Massachussets Sate House was outstanding. But the best thing about the place is the amazing king size bed. The mattress is about 2 foot thick!. Combine this with the excellent rate we got from Expedia and it was a 5 star trip for a 3 star price. Stay here when in Boston!",

It's only a few blocks from the Boston Common and right next to the theater district. It's walking distance to the Back Bay and Beacon Hill. The Boston Ballet (at the Opera House) is right across the street, which was very convienent. The room itself was nice, with very comfortable beds (my friend said they were a little too soft though, but I thought they were great). Their fitness center is also decent, with a selection of cardio equipment (4 treadmills, a few ellipticals, bikes and rowing machines), as well as weights and weight machines. There is a small pool, designed for laps (not very children-friendly if that's what you're looking for). Overall, it was a great experience for the weekend and I would definitely stay again.",

You enter the hotel on street level, then there are 3 steps down (even though a sign besides the sliding glass doors states Handicapped Accessible???) to a lower elevator level and then you have to take an elevator to go up to the 3rd floor for the Reception Area and then another set of elevators to get you to your room.YIkes!!!! Decor is dated, rooms are quite standard and for some inexplicable reason- I was put in a handicapped room. Furntiure in the room is definitely showing wear and tear and whatever they put on the top of their mattresses, some sort of padding, does not even extend the whole length of the mattress. To boot, I could not get the phone in my room to work properly as I could only manage to work it with the speaker micro on. Additonally, their minibar bar prices are stratospheric. The bar and resutrant in the Hotel Lobby is quite generic with nothing to make it stand out in one's mind. I stayed there because when I think Hyatt- I hink of a pleasant Atrium Area but, if there was one, I did not find it. The exterior of the buuilding is also quite ugly- like a grey concrete fortrress- nothing charming or elegant about it whatsoever. I ewill definitely NOT stay there again.",

The doorman was right there to carry my luggage all the way from the street to the lobby and asked if I would need it brought to my room. Great start! The reason for the two sets of elevators is for security purposes. The hotel wants to see who is coming and going to the rooms. One night I had to show my key to get on the second set of elevators to the rooms. This is a good thing. Check in was very pleasant and professional. I got the room through Priceline so I was expecting a view of the alley but what a pleasant surprise when I got a room on the 20th floor with a tremendous view of the financial district and the inner harbor islands. It was very nice and I was really happy to have it. The bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was fully stocked with products (even toothpaste). The best part of the hotel though is the gym. While not everyone looks for this when they travel, if you like to work out this gym had everything! This hotel was very nice. I would definitely go back.",

This time we wanted to try a location in Point Loma for a number of good reasons. After considering several options (most of the Pt. Loma properties are clustered close together) we opted to try the Dolphin based mainly on price and TripAdvisor reviews. We drove in after dark on I-8 and turned onto Nimitz Ave. at the end of the freeway which brought us right to the Dolphin. Our reservation was accepted and we checked in without problem. Our room was on the second floor which was fine. On first impression we were a bit surprised at the compactness of the room which reminded me of some I had stayed in throughout the UK. Apart from that the room was clean to an acceptable standard and everything that was in it worked accordingly. The place has a kind of '70's feel to it which we have experienced at other SoCal accomodations! We found that the Dolphin was a combination of several pluses and a couple of minuses. The pluses included being situated in Pt. Loma which is a self contained community with most amenities within easy walking distance of the Dolphin. There is a great selection of restaurants, C stores, laundromat, gas stations etc. nearby and the streets are safe to walk after dark. In many ways it resembles most large towns that you would find on the Great Plains with that same \"Howdy neighbour\" friendliness. Pt. Loma is also strategically located in SD to provide quick access to all of the local attractions. We found that having wi-fi was a great convenience as we packed the laptop along. Morning coffee,OJ, and muffins are served in the outdoor courtyard which is very nice on warm sunny mornings. As many other commenters have mentioned the staff and management are very nice folks. The minuses were few and rather petty. The hotel doesn't have a pool (one is located beside the office but belongs to the neighbouring Comfort Inn.) The hotel advertises itself as being on a quiet street (Garrison) which is technically correct, however it is sandwiched between two very busy streets (Rosecrans and Scott). My wife likes to sleep with the windows open and the early morning traffic was very noticeable. The street traffic can be overcome by closing the windows and turning on the circulating fan. Another irritant was the vibrating roar of fighter jets taking off from North Island late in the evening. The snug rooms are fine for sleeping but don't expect to entertain guests. Overall we were quite satisfied with our stay at the Dolphin and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to San Diego.",

The windows are not insulated so you will hear some street noise and the rooms are small.

The rooms are clean & up to date (if a bit on the small side; not a problem for most recreational visitors in New York). The AC was awesome; we like a cold room at night and NYC temperatures were over 100 degrees F during our stay. Wifi was free and problem free. One thing Doubletree does well is offer free breakfast (which was quite good). They will even let you forgo the buffet and cook an omelet for you. More important to me, as an early riser, they provided free coffee (upon request & with a voucher) in to-go cups so I could read the (free!) paper in the comfort of my room. Why is it that mid-priced hotels provided these nice perks but higher-line properties (at least in NYC) force me to search for coffee and paper every morning? Go figure. The immediate neighborhood left a little to be desired. There was a homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk next door to the hotel and 29th St. is a little dark at night, with little foot traffic.This left my wife feeling a little uneasy, however we were with another couple and did not feel threatened (safety in numbers). We spend 2 or 3 weekends per year in the city and I prefer neigborhoods with more activity in them, from both an entertainment and security point of view. Access to subways is OK, however East side subway service generally means more transfers to other parts of the city. We used cabs more that we usually do.",

First impression driving in: This CAN'T be it! It's a motel and looks like something you would find in the middle of nowwhere on a road trip. We were led into a dressing room of sorts and told to disrobe, put our personal belongs into a mesh hanging bag and put on a robe. The robes were a joke and did not appear to have been washed. We then had to drag our stuff in the hanging bag into the mud room. While the mud bath felt good, it was hard not to think about how many others I was bathing with if you know what I mean. We were then ushered into another room with our hanging bag for a blanket wrap where an old wool type blanket was thrown over us. When that was over, rather than just keeping us in the same where we've been relaxing, we are then led to another room, still dragging our stuff around, into the massage room. Apparently 2 out of 2 us got good massages while the other two recieved the worst massage we've ever had. Both of us were asked what our trouble spots were by the masseuse, who then completely disregarded what we said. I told my masseuse to feel free to \"dig in\" and I was told that was not the kind of massage she was giving me, that what I was getting is for people who are paralyzed, stroke victims, etc. What???!! The place was dark & dingy, appeared unclean and the $388 per couple + tips could have been better spent at a real spa and resort. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.",

                "content": "Hubby and I went for a couples spa package last weekend for my 40th bday last weekend. What fun! My husband was really worried about the mud bath (he's a clean freak), but even he found it relaxing, comfortable, and fun. I would do the mud bath again - I think he is fine having done it ONCE in his life. I wasn't sure what to expect, having heard tales from others of attendants shoveling hot mud over you while you lay in the mud, and then being sprayed w/power hoses to get the mud off. Nothing could be further from the truth! The attendant tells you what to do, and then leaves you to get in/out of the mud while she's out of the room. She puts cool towels on your forehead, applies a soothing face mask, and explains what the mud is all about and answers questions. After around 15 min in the mud, she returns to tell you to get out, rinse off (there's a curtained-off area, with 2 showers - one for each of you, with a stone bench to sit on if you like) and then you hop in to the jacuzzi, where you relax while drinking cool lemon water. From there, go to the cool-down room, where you're swaddled like a baby in a room with candles, a gurgling water feature, and new age music (which I would normally hate, but didn't mind becuase I was so relaxed). We had 30 minute massages, which were fabulous! I recommend Marcia - who massaged my husband. I think he got a better treatment than I did... though I was happy w/my masseuse (forgot name). We were given a mesh bag to keep our clothes/shoes clean/dry, and $@!#%-flops to walk around in. This seems contrary to what a previous poster mentioned. Golden Haven isn't the top of the line place, but for $108 each (check out online coupons), the 90 minute experience was a great value and a completely fun, relaxing experience. I want to return w/a friend or two. NOTE - don't go winetasting first - we were so glad we hadn't done so! All the heat of the mud and jacuzzi is dehydrating and would be uncomfortable if you had been drinking.",

I fell off my bicycle and broke my hip and was craving healing waters and mineral mud,so we decided to take a jacuzzi room and enjoy the waters come what may. We were delighted to find a pleasant room, spotlessly clean and equipped with small fridge, bottled water, tea, coffee and candy and plentiful fluffy towels and wash cloths. The room was remarkably quiet, tucked away from the main drag, with leafy trees. The staff were very pleasant and the spa facilities excellent. Yes, it's a motel, but you're not paying \"Four seasons\" prices. Especially in the off season, I think we had excellent value for money and the person who mentioned the smell must be unaccustomed to natural sulphur smells from all mineral springs. In fact, I was hardly aware of it, maybe because we took a perfumed candle. So, if you want a reasonably priced, clean, quiet spa experience and you're not a snob, go for Golden Haven. J.C.",

It's a little off the main street and we thought we'd taken wrong turn at first, but from the moment of check-in until we left, it was a completely relaxing, self-indulgent experience that we hope to repeat this summer. We stayed in the jacuzzi room and it was wonderful to soak right before going to bed and first thing in the morning. We had signed up for the couples mud bath and giggled like kids when we were left alone to wriggle down into the mud. It was heaven! We both dozed off (easy after a day of visiting wineries) but the hot spring fed mud bath was extremely relaxing and hot enough for my \"make me sweat\" husband who figured out how to move around to increase the temperature around him. I like a little cooler than he does so I simply didn't move and found the temperature of the mud to be perfect. We washed off, soaked in the jacuzzi and headed for our heated blanked wrap (nap time again) and then an hour long-massage. We had plans of going out for dinner afterwards, but felt so great that we went back to our room and stayed there for the rest of the night. The facilities were clean, the people were friendly and we saw several relaxed, happy people walking around the spa. We highly recommend Golden Haven for your next visit to the area.",

                "content": "We had a TERRIBLE experience at this spa. Admittedly we were 10 minutes late for our appointment for a couples mud bath and massage, but we did not feel the treatment we received was called for. The reception staff were unfriendly and unprofessional. They acted as if they were exasperated and seem inconvenienced at having to wait on us. We felt exteremly unwelcome. We had signed up for an hour mud bath and an hour massage at a promotional rate. Because we were 10 minutes late, our massage time had to be cut in half. Thankfully, we were charged a pro-rated promotional rate. However, the relatively inexpensive price was no consolation for very poor service. In fact, after the entire experience we still felt as though we had been \"ripped off.\" We did not know what to expect with the mud bath, as it was our first experience. This part of our spa treatment seemed very rushed. Our attendant seemed somewhat friendly, but seemed to push us through each of the stages of the mud bath, mineral soak and blanket wrap as though we were in a race. The actual soak time in the mud was about 10 minutes, which we heard, after some research, is probably the shortest soak time alloted amongst all the other spas in Calistoga. During the blanket wrap, we were supposed to retire or even nap in relaxing silence. And despite a sign posted right outside the room requesting quiet, we heard loud laughing and talking the whole time, which made it extremely difficult to fall asleep let alone relax. Our half hour massage was probably the best part of our experience, although that is not saying much. The massage therapists greeted us and bid us farewell very hastily. However, the massage was fairly good, but definitely not near the best we've had. (Perahps we are a bit biased in this opinion because we were already pretty upset by this point.) Overall, we had a very disappointing experience, especially since we had been looking forward to it for a while. We both felt a lot LESS relaxed coming out of the spa than we did going in! We kept joking that what we needed now was a massage since we felt a bit stressed! We would definitely not recommend this spa to anyone. It is much more worth your while to pay a little extra to get much better service. After our very disheartening experience, we went shopping around at several other spas in Calistoga. It seemed like common knowledge among the locals that Golden Haven has a reputation for providing rushed, unfriendly service and for \"herding\" their large numbers of customers through their spa experiences. In some cases, all we had to mention was that we had an extremely poor spa experience and people guessed exactly where we were talking about. That is pretty bad! If friendly, welcoming, accomodating service is essential to you to have a good experience, please do not waste your time here! In spite of the many positive reviews this spa has received, we definitely encourage you to shop around and get a feel for what the locals' opinions are. We think that you will find that every spa will recommend itself, but the good spas will also have some recommendations for other good spas in the area and will have a strong opinion as to where NOT to go, which will be.......take a guess!!! We hope you have a better experience than ours wherever you decide to go!",

                "content": "Culebra is a quiet island, a place to relax, a place to enjoy sunshine, beaches, and snorkeling. We have enjoyed visiting Culebra eight times, staying at Tamarindo Estates the last six times. A special place to which we will surely return. Tamarindo Estates is a modest, well-maintained, gated refuge. The twelve house-keeping units are small but adequate---simple but clean. The kitchens are OK for breakfasts and lunches; we have not tried to cook dinners. The terraces provide spectacular views of sunsets and starry, night-time skies. The management is friendly and responsive to all requests. The Tamarindo Estates private waterfront is broken coral, not sand, and access to the water is difficult (enter at the north end), but once in one finds wonderful snorkeling (turn south, left, along the outer edge of the coral heads). A quarter-mile walk distant is Tamarindo Beach, which provides sand and easy access for less spectacular snorkeling. Difficult to reach Carlos Rosario Beach may offer snorkeling better or equal to that at Tamarindo Estates, but there is no other equal on the island or perhaps elsewhere in the Caribbean. Also on the Tamarindo Estates waterfront is a small, well-maintained, fresh-water swimming pool. A Jeep is essential on Culebra. We have rented from Carlos. Three colmados in town provide adequate grocery selections. Restaurants change from year to year, with Mamacitas, Dinghy Dock, and Barbara Rosaâ€™s perennial and enduring favorites. Flamenco Beach is spectacular. It is crowded on weekends, as is much of the island, which makes one appreciate even more the privacy of Tamarindo Estates. We have stayed on Belize, Bonaire, Saint Vincent, and Puerto Ricoâ€™s big island. Culebra tops all, and Tamarindo Estates is in our opinion the best place to stay on Culebra.",

                "content": "We are from New York and traveled to Puerto Rico for a family reunion and decided to do it at Tamarindo Estates. Each little apartment kitchen had everything we needed from dishwashing soap in the kitchen, pots and pans, paper towels and the bathrooms were clean and wer also equiped with soap, shampoo and conditioner. Each small apartment has a balcony with tables and chairs. There is a shower outside to clean up before going to the apartment. There is a barbecue pit in front of the villas with tables. The place was clean and comfortable. The walk to the beach is a long one but once you get there the view is fabulous. The pool is a good size and the pool house is equipmed with bathrooms and shower. The beach house has tables and you can also barbecue there. The property manager was very helpful and was always there when we needed him. Adults and kids enjoyed the place. The best snorkling in the island is right in front of this property, we found out it is a natural reserve. The only problem we found is that you must bring your food supplies from the main island or be prepared to pay the prices of culebra. They do not have supermarkets but small stores. We found everything we needed but not always in the same place. Make sure that you rent a jeep (we did) or you will not be able to move around at wish. We did find that taxi drivers are easy to find and during off hours if you make previous arrangements they will pick you up and wait for you to take you back to the hotel. There are many restaurants in town. Recommendations: The most beautiful beach is Flamenco beach - a taxi ride away. You can walk it but there are no side walks and you can not always see the cars coming so we decided it was safer to drive there. There you will find kiosks with food and beverages. Make sure you get your ferry tickets early as they sold out fast and be on line at least an hour before if you are traveling with luggage. There is a car transport that works from Monday to Friday, if you want to take your car from the mainland a reservation is needed but it does not work on Saturday and Sundays. All and all we will do it again. If what you are looking is a quiet, peaceful place full of nature. This is it. We are ready to do it again..",

We had reservations at \"A Wind Chimes\" hotel and were told they did not have our reservation but we could stay at their sister hotel, Acacia. We were told at ten o,clock at night to carry our bags down the very dark street to the Acacia. Wait a moment, we were booked at one hotel and switched to another. For two weary travelers it was to much to comprehend and we trudged to the Acacia. Beware upon arrival they slam you with there rules one of which is you can not get your money back if the room does not meet your expectations. I awoke to having a severe allergic reaction which I recognized instantly as being the result of the presence of mold. My husband investigated and found considerable mold in the bathroom and air conditioner. My husband and I agreed that we could not remain at the hotel. We expressed our desire to leave the hotel to the desk clerk who referred the matter to her manager.The manager was a very rude women who in no uncertain terms advised us that we had booked a four night stay and if we desired to leave we would be charged for a three night stay. To our shock, the problems my wife was having with the mold in the room WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED!!! We left the hotel very bitter and completely resentful of the way we were treated. So beware if you should become ill or have an emergency you will be in for the three night stay rule.",

The director and all of the other staff were so accommodating. They help with anything you need (cabs, places to go, etc) and are on a first name basis. Our king room was a perfect size with a large tv and private bath (all of them have private bathes) and the bed was comfy with soft, light linens. We read reviews about kings being two twins stuck together, but that was not the case. Our room had a private back balcony, but many of them had front balconies overlooking the HUGE hot tub. The tub is amazing to say the least. It's the largest one in San Juan with jets everywhere and two waterfalls. The view from the pool and most balconies is a partial oceanview. The tall tower The hotel is so close to the beach, which is great for walking back easily. Pamela's on the beach is just east (a 10 minute beach walk) where you can eat in the sand. They have outdoor showers to rinse off, towels and cucumber/fruit water available in the lobby, and on the ground level is this delicious restaurant called Niche ... let's just say the food is unbelievable. Best meal in San Juan. Some tips to note to travelers: this is not a cookie cutter resort with all of the amenities. What you get with this place is a cozy, comfy little getaway. It is on the east end of Condado, so a bit away from the happening bars and restaurants and a bit further from Old San Juan. However, its close enough for long walks or short cab rides and is worth the peacefulness, service, food, and beach location! There is a really cool deli (Kasalta - that President Obama visited) and other restaurants to the east that are easy to walk to from Acacia. We highly recommend this place and expect to stay again in the near future.",

I fell in love with Vieques Island and the sister property - Inn on the Blue Horizon. Brenda gave us directions for every phase of the trip, from the transportation to the ferry to setting up the Kayak and snorkeling tours for us. Our room on the second level, adjacent to the hot-tub made for some very relaxing evenings after dinner. The Inn is immaculate - from the entry lobby to our room. The hot tub and surrounding area was washed down everyday as well as all tile areas around the Inn. Our room with two double beds was very spacious. Now, let's talk about getting around. The Inn is located in Condado, and we walked almost everywhere. Very safe, as there was always lots of activity and great police presence. When we needed a taxi, the front desk called and it was never more than 4 mintues until the taxi arrived. And of course, the beach is 1/2 block down the street from the Inn and clean and beautiful. We walked down Ashford to shopping, casinos, restaurants and the lovely gem of a spa - Euphoria. If you want the BEST food in San Juan - JUST STAY AT THE ACACIA AND DINE AT - NICHE!!!! We had our breakfast daily of the most lovely fresh fruit and coffee. Dinner - served by the most lovely Donna, was incredible...... Lobster soaked in vanilla and pumpkin risotto.......beef that melts in your mouth.......asparagus/mushroom risotto...... Believe me when I say they are there to take care of you. The wine list was very reasonable and had great selection. And did I mention the LOVELY DONNA????? If you are looking for loud noise, bustling activity, impersonal service, and cookie cutter environment then this is not the place.......BUT should you want to spend your vacation with a wonderful group of people, in a relaxing, clean, well appointed Inn that has access to all the \"night-life\" if you choose, and great hot tub if you don't, then please make a reservation for the Acacia - you will not be sorry. PS: We stayed for 8 nights - so we really got to know the staff and the Inn.....they never changed - from check-in to check-out it was a wonderful choice for my first week long vacation since 2007!",

Chad; parter, concierge and all around hospitality guru, walked us past the most amazing Buda (see pic) and into Niche.

It's a given that the rooms are more than comfortable. We had the best forced layover we could imagine.",

I have a high stress job, and before the summer season gets busy, we thought it would be good to plan a short vacation. We are couple in our 30s from DC, and we love to travel. We take a few trips each year throughout the Caribbean, the U.S. and around the world. Initially, we looked at Acacia because of the amazing reviews, but settled on La Concha Renaissance because of Marriott points and the pools. The Renaissance is nice, but we wish we would have stayed at Acacia. During our trip, we had an opportunity to visit Acacia's restaurant, Niche, for dinner. I've eaten at many upscale restaurants in my time, but this is in my top 20 of dinners. The food was creative and amazing, plus the chef came out to greet us - very nice guy. Chad Siegel - I can't say enough. Chad manages the hotel, and is extremely knowledgeable, nice, and understands the importance of customer service. I work in PR, a very customer-service based business and I don't understand how people don't get it. Although we stayed at the Renaissance, Chad was our concierage. He was extremely patient with us, and took time to answer our questions and provide entertainment and restaurant recommendations, and we were not even staying at the Acacia. Honestly, the concierage at the Renaissance was not as helpful or knowledgeable. Our experience in Puerto Rico would have been miserable if we didn't stop by Niche and talk with Chad. He also took the time to give us a tour of the hotel - absolutely romantic and beautiful. We were bummed because we saw what we were missing. The next time I visit Puerto Rico, I'm staying at Acacia and booking room #307. Acacia - Mike and Catrell thank you for taking such good care of us.",

                "content": "I did a fair amount of research to find a smaller high-end hotel near the ocean (a block) and central enough to enjoy the restaurants and the general culture. I am happy to report I got both. The front of the house staff Claudio and Palmerra were excellent. Both very professional, genuine and very nice people. The hearts of the people of San Juan are large and that is what makes it such a great place to visit. I like smaller intimate places because you actually get to know the staff first hand and the owner is a lucky man to have these two steering his ship. But wait there's more...the food is fabulous... however you need to cut through the hype and get to the real wonderful Puerto Rican and Caribbean cuisine..it's a family oriented culture and food matters. I am very judgmental when it comes to my food...I want the place clean, I want good service, I want to feel the owner gets what he is doing and wants to deliver consistently. My three hands down favorites were Kasalta's for breakfast every morning one of the local hangouts (they have lunch, dinner and take out as well)...Kasalta's is a gem. Picayo at the art museum is on the fine dining side and is also fabulous...the front of the house Maitre D', Martin is a gifted man when it comes to hospitality and on my second visit Martin introduced us to Chef Wilo Benet who is a force in the cuisine of his country. An engaging chef who cares about delivering fine high end food. Metropol another local down home Puerto Rican eatery was another treasure. The waiter Raffie took a one look at me and told me I had to try the roast pork (I guess he knows his Boston Irish tourist palettes), the engaging staff immediately served up some amazing bread, and Raffi kept the house wine from Spain coming...Raffi brought out a bowl of chopped garlic marinated in olive oil as a sauce for the pig and I was in heaven! A few other mentionable's were Miro, Bebo and the Tapas bar (forget the name) next to Dragon Flies in old San Juan...on the down side Pasteria near the hotel was a bust lots of staff but no service, no one cleaning the tables or cleaning the place...so the floor was strewn with napkins and food. No excuse for that in my opinion... it starts at the top and the owner doesn't get the food service business. I was also disappointed in BuddaThai. El San Juan on Friday and Saturday nites is fun. I also suggest getting up early one morning grabbing a few bottles of water and walking to Old San Juan..its a good hike (5 or so miles)...but will give you a great idea of the area and what is all about. There is a great lagoon right before the bridge. All and all Acacia was exactly what I needed. We both work long hours and I travel a lot so we just wanted to chill and pretty much do nothing except hit the beach, take a bunch of hikes, and check out the local cuisine.",

The desk clerks were extremely nice and helpful. They recommended places to eat and answered all our questions.

                "content": "Good points: Very clean, nice decor, nice complimentary breakfast, nice pool, free computer use, good value, very central in LA for public transport (metro bus & trains 5 minutes walk away) if do not have a car, very handy to Hollywood Walk of fame, Madame Tausands Wax museum, Ripleys Believe it or not, theatres etc (5 minutes walk) & Universal studios (10 minutes by local bus @ $1.50 ea way). Will look after bags if check out early & pick up later. Seemed to have a nice clientele - lots of friendly people from Europe, Canada and Australia staying there, many families. Negative points: Room was very stuffy because windows do not open much. Many rooms only look into a wall (not good if claustraphobic!) Busy street - traffic very noisy - we had to turn on the air conditioner all night so it would drown out the road noise. Police sirens, helicopters & fire engines much of the night. Hollywood is generally quite a seedy area - lots of homeless people, beggars & weirdos wandering about, but most of LA seems to be like that these days! I noticed that the Magic Castle Hotel, very nearby, is on a quieter street and gets very good reviews, but it charges a lot more. Recommend eating at The California Pizza restaurant, upstairs on the corner of Hollywood & Highland. Greek Pizza scrumptious. Recommend not booking any LA tours until you arrive as they offer lots of discount vouchers in the main street, as well as deals for seeing multiple attractions, such as a tour plus wax museum. This hotel was also selling two day passes to Universal studios for the price of 1 day (but note that it is much cheaper to take local bus than to buy a pass that includes transport). We did La City Tour A1 - Venice Beach (very, very seedy & dangerous at night), Santa Monica Beach, Dowtown including oldest house in LA, Hollywood, then Movie Stars houses in Beverly Hills etc. A good way to see a great deal of LA in one day. But be aware that if you initially get a crappy seat on their mini bus they make you stay in the same one all day even though you paid as much as the people in the front row (good reason not to give a tip to tour guide who insists on noboby moving seats!) We also took the local bus (Dash Hollywood @ 25cents each) to the Beverly Centre shopping mall - there are also Outlet stores across the road at \"The Beverly Connection\" - designer shoes, handbags, clothes at greatly reduced prices.",

Also our room was opposite the laundry and so 'thanks' go out to those girls who congregated there and chatted away at full volume whilst we tried to sleep and who also ignored our requests (twice) to please take their conversation elsewhere (perhaps their own room??). Don't these people realise that all those doors in the corridors are bedrooms at the end of the day? Of course being so close to the 'action' our saturday night was punctuated by significant noise from late night revellers (drunks) coming home at all hours. OK so these might not be directly the hotel's fault -there is no accounting for people, but maybe hotels should try and take some responsibilty - heck why not even put up a sign saying no noise after 10pm or something - it might be a start!",

                "content": "Checked in here late at night, small problem that I had booked wrong date, however hotel honoured booking and did not charge extra. Our room was a great size, had two double/queen beds, a sofa bed, small table and chairs. Also a small kitchen area with a microwave, small fridge. I thought the room would be noisy as it overlooked busy road, it turned out to be a very quiet room. Breakfast was great, it is a continental breakfast, but is more than adequate to get you through the morning. It consisted of cereal, toast, bagels, boiled eggs, juices, yoghurt, coffee, tea and hot chocolate ( I seem to recall scrambled eggs and bacon too, but am not 100% sure). Had pizza and salad from across the road, which was great. There is also a Subway sandwich shop and a small general store. The proximity of this hotel to the walk of fame, train etc was fantastic. It was an easy five minute walk from the hotel to this hub. Many restuarants in the large shopping centre, plus lots of shopping around. We took a bus from this area to venice beach (well two buses), it took close to an hour to get there. Staff were great and helped book a car for our return to the airport, and printed our boarding passes. Would absolutely stay here again.",

Hollywood itself seems to be quite overrated but the hotel was a great place to call home for six days. Check-in was easy and all of the front desk staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant. Had a nice chat with the girls while they were watching the Super Bowl during the quieter moments of the day. They even helped us plan our trip to the San Diego Zoo (and remembered us well enough to ask how it was when we returned). The room was quite spacious though perhaps a little dark with no proper lights, only floor and table lamps. Bathroom was nice and the bed super comfy...not much street noise either and you'd never know that busy Hollywood Blvd was close by. Free buffet breakfast every morning was a Godsend - nice supply of toast, bagels, cinnamon rolls, various cereals, milk, yoghurt, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, coffee, fruit, and more...fabulous! As a tip, it's probably a good idea to swipe a couple of paper plates, bowls and some cutlery from the breakfast room in the morning as although there is a kitchenette in the room, there is nothing to eat your food on or with. Only had two problems during our stay, both of which were handled by staff very, very quickly. Once our room key stopped working and it was immediately replaced by the girls on the desk, and towards the end of the trip our toilet backed up but the maintenance man was quick to fix that also. The free Wi-Fi was horribly slow at times in our 4th floor room...that's probably the only real complaint I would have. The small business centre was more than adequate for those times where we had to email home. We didn't have a car for the whole duration of our holiday but as tourists we made good use of the hop-on hop-off buses that most major touristy cities have. The company we used in Hollywood started from outside the Chinese Theatre so that was very convenient and the information they provided, as well as the variety of loops to take you to Downtown LA, Santa Monica, the hills, etc were great. Ordered in a couple of nights from some of the restaurants listed in the hotel's booklet...good experiences all round. There's a convenience store and Subway across the road (if you can ignore all of the scary people hanging around at night), and the sushi restaurant, Shinto is to die for! Best sushi, and affordable, that I have ever had! Overall we had a great stay at Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Hollywood Walk of Fame.",

The hotel was located near a few popular museums and within walking distance to a few restaurants...but the price and overall hotel experience is not worth this location. Amsterdam is a small city and you can walk to everything easily (or take public transportation). The hotel is not very sound proof - I could hear trams running, cars driving on the street, and people talking on the street all night long. I could also hear other people in other hotel rooms talking and walking around their room. On my first day at the hotel, I was waiting to talk with the receptionist while he was helping another person. Thee receptionist created a hotel card key for my room for this person. I only caught this because I was standing at the reception desk and the receptionist said here is a key for room 312 as the people were walking, I pointed out to the receptionist that room 312 was my room...the receptionist called back the people and made them a different key. Not sure what would have happened if I would not have been standing at the reception desk. I would not stay in the hotel again.",

When the tide was up, you could see surfers riding waves right by your room as you sat in the living room. The sound and feel of the waves crashing beneath you are just the coolest most relaxing thing ever. When I do return, I will want that same cottage. A&B are the 2 on the end, but you get more privacy from the public pier on the end. Another great feature is your car is parked right alongside your cottage (easy for loading/unloading!)

                "content": "I was invited to tag along with some friends that were staying at the Crystal Pier for a few days and I am so glad I did. The location is amazing, the cottages are nicely furnished and the sunsets from the pier are spectacular. A few negatives; we were given cottage 22 which appears to be the â€œruntâ€� of the cottages. It didnâ€™t have a futon as the other cottages have but it did have two twin size roll out beds. We had our own patio but it was so small that it only contained one lounge chair and a small round table with two (not four) patio chairs and no umbrella. The kitchen was so small that we couldnâ€™t reach the microwave unless we moved the dining chairs away from the table. Another issue was that none of the outlets in the kitchen worked except the one the toaster and coffee pot were already plugged into. From what I could see of the other cottages, ours appeared quite a bit smaller. We were disappointed that we didnâ€™t have a French door as the other cottages did and we had to park a good distance from our front door and not in front of the cottage as other guests could. The parking was a nightmare too. You are only allowed one assigned parking spot per cottage and you get locked in by all the other cars lined up bumper to bumper. The front desk clerk was grumpy about us driving through the gate before we got a key but no one was outside to tell us not to. She was less than friendly at check in. Youâ€™d think the front desk staff would be a little nicer and more professional for the amount of money you pay to stay there. The bathroom was fine and the shower had great water pressure. We brought lots of food with us and even made a big dinner one night. The kitchen did have all the basic necessities (pots, pans, dishes & utensils). You can also get a barbeque grill from the front desk (you provide the charcoal). All in all, it was a fabulous stay. I will definitely return but wonâ€™t stay in Cottage 22 again. I donâ€™t think it warrants the same rate as the other larger 1 bedroom units. There are also tons of shops and restaurants very close. I recommend visiting Pangaea for a cool shopping experience but make sure you have enough time to see everything in this large and very diverse store. Also, try Bustamanteâ€™s on Garnet Ave. We had a fantastic breakfast/lunch. Good selection on the menu; Mexican cuisine, plus omelets, pancakes, Belgium waffles, you name it. All very good food made from scratch. Good sized servings and each meal came with a fruit cup to start. Also, Edgar is the best waiter/host you can ask for. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great time and everyone at the table was happy. Be careful not to park on Garnet Street overnight though. I got a $40 ticket for being there between 3am â€“ 6am Tuesday morning when the street sweeper came around.",

While the physical property is interesting, this part of San Diego is a bit dumpy, unless you like homeless people sleeping all around you while you are on vacation at the beach. But the reall problem is the staff. To say they are below the standard for the hoteling world is an understandment. If I owned this place, they would all be replaced. It was extraordinary to have every person who I had an encounter with to have such a poor disposition. Beware of this place!",

Contrary to a few (minority) of reviewers that rate the staff as uncourteous, we have always found the staff to be very accomodating and outstanding in their service to customers. The only thing I can think of is that these folks are writing poor reviews to \"keep others\" away and have the pier to themselves! It is true that the pier is quite popular and it is very difficult to get a reservation, but that all goes with being an outstanding property. I graciously give the Pier 5 STARS and recommend it to all!",

It is situated at the start of the bars, restaurants, and entertainment on gentrified 5th Ave., a stone’s throw from the Westfield Horton Shopping Plaza where tour buses stop. Walking a bit further brings you to the convention center and touristy waterfront. Taxis to must-visit Balboa Park are around $10. We were able to book a very large top floor suite for a weekday rate of less than $200 per night. The small staff who rotate through the front desk were friendly and in our case exceptionally helpful. The hotel’s self-serve breakfast is modest but provided on the roof top (part of which is under cover) where the view more than compensates. We found this historic property to be clean and well maintained… very easy to recommend.",
