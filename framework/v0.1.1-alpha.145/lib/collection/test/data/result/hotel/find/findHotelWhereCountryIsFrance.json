It's close to some great restaurants and just far enough from Bourbon street so that it isn't noisy. The indoor pool on the 10th floor was nice, too. No complaints here.",

        "content": "I must explain this history in order that you know what kind of hotel you are going to stay. 2011- Mardi Grass. During the week of the 9th March, we stayed at this hotel for a few days. When we checked out, we drove direction Baton Rouge. As we arrived, we found out that my husband had lost his back bag with all documents, passport, computer, etc. somewhere... The recepcionist in Super 8 La Place helped us a lot. We were very nervous, and she even let us phone to New Orleans just to check if our bag was there. No news, but finally, we decided to drove back to New Orleans. As we arrived the recepcionist, Nimahs, helped us a lot! Security guy, Dal, also. But as they didnÂ´t know about the lost bag, we asked to check the security cameras. The responsible guy came, and checked the cameras with my husband. Thanks to that, the bag was found! Happy end of the history thanks to that people! No one accepted any tips from us. We surely will recomend Super 8 hotels from now on. On the other hand, I must say that this is not a well located hotel if you want to party every night in the French Quarter. But we thought it was a good choice, also thinking about prices, and because we had our own car.",

        "content": "We read reviews of motels in New Orleans before choosing this one based on good feedback from others. It turned out to be a good choice, for it was a comfortable stay and the staff obviously put a lot of effort into making it a quality establishment. When we left they even had staff doing work in the garden. The room itself was good, with two beds, a fridge and coffee maker. Amazingly, the wifi also worked in the room, which I found to be something of a rarity for places in this price range. The floor sloped slightly downwards, which was a bit odd, but it didn't matter at all. There is plenty of parking, even if the spaces are quite tight. The motel is equipped with a gym, which I didn't use, plus an outdoor pool, which looked quite good but was far too cold when I was there. The business center was very useful, for I was able to print out flight tickets. Breakfast was good (though waffles would enhance it!), but was packed away promptly at 9:30. It was good to fill up in the morning while watching the news before going into New Orleans for the day. That brings me to the location - it's not in an area that you'd want to walk around, but isn't too far from fast food places and is very close to the interstate, so it's easy to get into New Orleans itself. A lot of the motels in New Orleans are in this area. This is an impressive motel and I would happily stay here again if I was every lucky enough to be able to return to New Orleans.",
