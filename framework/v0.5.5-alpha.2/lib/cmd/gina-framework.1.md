## DESCRIPTION
**gina framework** alows you to perform tasks on the framework and its services.

## OPTIONS

**-t**, **--status**
		Get status of the framework.

**-h**, **--help**

## TASKS

**-s**, **start**
		Starts the framework.

**-k**, **stop** | **kill**
		Stops the framework.

**-r**, **restart**
    	Restarts the framework.

**-u**, **update**
    	Reconcile the ~/.gina state files (main.json, settings.json) to the installed framework version. Dry-run by default; pass --fix to apply.

**add**
    	Install a published gina version side-by-side so a bundle can pin it via --gina-version. Downloads from npm, installs its deps, archives + symlinks it, and registers it in main.json. Additive — never changes the default version. Pass --dry-run to preview, --force to overwrite an existing archived copy.

**list**
    	List the framework versions known to this install: the active version, side-by-side symlinked versions, and archived copies. Pass --all to include versions registered in main.json but not on disk, --format=json for machine output.

**-e**, **set**
		Set environment variables
