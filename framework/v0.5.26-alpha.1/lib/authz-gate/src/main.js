/**
 * @module gina/lib/authz-gate
 *
 * The #COMPLY1 authorization gate — the framework's request-path authorization
 * enforcement point.
 *
 * A route opts in by declaring authorization keys in `routing.json`:
 *
 *   "account": {
 *       "method" : "GET",
 *       "url"    : "/account",
 *       "param"  : { "control": "account", "requireAuth": true }
 *   }
 *
 *   "admin-panel": {
 *       "method" : "GET",
 *       "url"    : "/admin",
 *       "param"  : { "control": "panel", "roles": ["admin", "editor"] }
 *   }
 *
 *   "invoice-edit": {
 *       "method" : "PUT",
 *       "url"    : "/invoices/:id",
 *       "param"  : { "control": "edit", "id": ":id", "policy": "ownsInvoice" }
 *   }
 *
 * `core/server.js` lints every declared key at bundle BOOT (fail-fast: a
 * non-boolean `param.requireAuth`, a `param.roles` that is not a non-empty
 * array of non-empty strings, or a `param.policy` naming a missing / broken /
 * async module, refuses to boot) and resolves the login-bounce target ONCE
 * there onto `process.gina._authConf`. This module then runs before the
 * controller action, at BOTH `core/router.js` dispatch sites, and:
 *
 *   1. NO-OPs for any route that declares no authorization key;
 *   2. authenticates first — `param.roles` and `param.policy` both IMPLY
 *      `requireAuth`, since an unauthenticated caller can hold no role and no
 *      policy can meaningfully judge a caller that is not signed in. An
 *      unauthenticated request is terminated here: a browser navigation is
 *      snapshotted (`pauseRequest`) and bounced to the configured login route;
 *      everything else gets a machine-readable **401**;
 *   3. then matches roles — ANY-of: the session user's `user.roles` must
 *      intersect the declared set;
 *   4. then runs the policy — the record/attribute escape hatch RBAC cannot
 *      express (ownership and the like). AND-composed: a route declaring both
 *      needs both to pass.
 *
 * Every denial from steps 3-4 is a **403** whose body stays GENERIC — the
 * required roles and the policy name are never echoed to the wire (they name
 * the bundle's authorization model, and a 403 that lists what WOULD have been
 * enough is a disclosure to exactly the caller that failed it); the specifics
 * go to the server-side log only.
 *
 * It is a strict NO-OP for every route that declares no authorization key, so an
 * existing bundle is byte-identical.
 *
 * ## The roles contract (#COMPLY1 defines it; the app populates it)
 * `req.session.user.roles` is a plain array of opaque role-name strings — the
 * framework imposes no vocabulary and no role→permission indirection (v1 names
 * roles directly; an indirection layer is a demand-gated follow-up). The app
 * populates it at login alongside `session.user`. Absent or non-array means the
 * user holds no roles, so every role-gated route answers 403 for that session.
 *
 * ## The policy contract — SYNCHRONOUS, allow iff `=== true`
 * A `param.policy` names a `<bundle>/policies/<name>.js` module exporting a plain
 * function:
 *
 *   // <bundle>/policies/ownsInvoice.js
 *   module.exports = function (user, req) {
 *       return req.params.ownerId === user.id;
 *   };
 *
 * It is registered at BOOT (`registerPolicy`) onto `process.gina._policies`, so the
 * request path is an O(1) lookup — no fs, no re-require (which would also feed the
 * dev-mode `module.children` leak class, #B32).
 *
 * The contract is synchronous because the GATE is synchronous — `authorizeRequest`
 * returns a boolean that both `core/router.js` dispatch sites branch on directly.
 * Two rules make that safe rather than merely convenient:
 *
 *   * an `async function` policy is **refused at boot**. Its constructor name reads
 *     `AsyncFunction`, which is the only boot-visible tell (`typeof` says 'function'
 *     for both), so the author learns at deploy instead of watching the route deny
 *     every request forever;
 *   * a policy that merely RETURNS a promise (the transpiled-async shape) is
 *     boot-INVISIBLE — its constructor reads `Function`. So the allow test is
 *     strictly `=== true`: a promise is truthy but not `true`, and a truthy-allow
 *     gate would ALLOW it unconditionally — the control silently OFF, inverted into
 *     fail-OPEN. Anything that is not literally `true` denies, and a non-boolean
 *     return warns ONCE naming the policy so the contract violation is visible
 *     without flooding the log.
 *
 * A throwing policy denies (403) and never 500s the wire. Async tolerance is a
 * demand-gated follow-up: `(user, req)` extends compatibly to `(user, req, cb)`.
 *
 * ## Why the gate sits before the DTO pipe
 * `core/router.js` calls this immediately BEFORE `dtoPipe.validateRequestPayload`,
 * extending the invariant that site already codifies (auth precedes validation):
 * an unauthenticated caller must never learn whether its payload WOULD have
 * validated — a 422 field map is a disclosure. Route middleware has already
 * drained by then, so a bundle's own auth middleware keeps its semantics and this
 * gate is purely additive after it.
 *
 * ## The authentication contract (#COMPLY1 defines it; the app populates it)
 * A request is authenticated **iff `req.session.user` is truthy**. That is read
 * DIRECTLY rather than through `router.js`'s Passport `request.isAuthenticated()`
 * shim, which is installed only conditionally (on a `_passport` / `session`
 * probe), has no framework caller, and itself converges onto `request.session.user`
 * — so the property IS the contract and the shim stays a userland convenience.
 * Populating it at login is the application's job (later #COMPLY3 ships helpers).
 *
 * ## The machine-caller path (#MS3 — service-to-service callers)
 * A caller that cannot hold a session — another bundle via `self.query()`, a
 * job runner, an external service — authenticates per request with
 * `Authorization: Bearer <key>` against `settings.json > auth.machine`
 * (opt-in, fail-closed; `core/server.js` lints it at boot and precomputes a
 * sha256 hash per configured caller onto `process.gina._authConf.machine`, so
 * the request path compares fixed-length digests and never retains a raw key).
 * SESSION WINS: the machine resolution runs only when no authenticated session
 * is present, and only for GATED routes — an un-gated route never pays a
 * compare, and `enabled: false` (the default) is byte-identical to the
 * pre-#MS3 gate. On a match the gate stamps
 * `req.machineCaller = { name, roles, machine: true }` — the effective
 * principal for roles matching and for policies (which can discriminate via
 * `principal.machine === true`), and the identity `lib/audit`'s `deriveActor`
 * and the controller's `self.hasRole` read. A PRESENTED but invalid Bearer
 * credential gets a clean 401 + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` and NEVER the
 * login bounce (a 302-to-login is meaningless to a service client); per-route
 * granularity rides `roles` — keep a route human-only by requiring a role no
 * configured caller holds, or machine-only by requiring a role only callers
 * hold. There is deliberately NO per-route opt-in key.
 *
 * ## The custom authenticator hook (#MS3 — the escape hatch)
 * `auth.machine.authenticator` names a `<bundle>/authenticators/<name>.js`
 * module — the `policies/<name>.js` shape, applied to authN — exporting a
 * SYNCHRONOUS `function (req) { return { name, roles } | null; }`. It runs
 * for gated, session-less requests AFTER the built-in caller map (map first,
 * first success wins) and REGARDLESS of whether a Bearer header is present,
 * so it can verify any sync-checkable credential: a JWT signature
 * (`jwt.verify` with a local secret/public key is synchronous), an HMAC
 * header, an `x-api-key` scheme. The gate NORMALIZES its return — the
 * principal is always `{ name, roles: [], machine: true }`-shaped regardless
 * of what the hook returns beyond `name`. Registered at BOOT
 * (`registerAuthenticator` → `process.gina._authenticators`) with the same
 * fail-fast lint as policies — an `async function` refuses to boot for the
 * same reason (the gate is synchronous; a promise is truthy but not a
 * principal), and at request time a THROW or a malformed return is
 * fail-closed unauthenticated (warn-once), never a 500. A custom-scheme
 * rejection (no Bearer presented) degrades to the ORDINARY 401/bounce — the
 * machine 401 (`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`) stays Bearer-specific.
 *
 * ## Why the bounce is a 302 + no-store, unconditionally
 * `controller.redirect()` cannot be reused for it: it defaults to a **cacheable
 * 301** (`req.routing.param.code || 301`, read off whichever route object the
 * branch left on the request) and only applies the no-store set when the request
 * is dev-mode or proxy-classified (#B68). A cached auth bounce is a login LOOP —
 * the browser replays the redirect for the later, now-authenticated visit and
 * never reaches the page. So the bounce is emitted here, mirroring `redirect()`'s
 * proven exit shape (`writeHead` + the `{status, headers}` body the inter-bundle
 * `query()` 3xx intercept replays) with the status and the no-store set forced.
