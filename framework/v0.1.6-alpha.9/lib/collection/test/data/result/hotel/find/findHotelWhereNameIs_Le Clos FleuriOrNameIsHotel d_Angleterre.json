                "content": "Domina Home Ca' Zusto was an excellent choice for our four day stay in Venice. It is a small hotel in the San Croce district, deceptively nondescript from the outside, yet once inside, abundant marble, lovely staircases, warm and very lively decor, just minutes from San Marco and the Rialto bridge. We found it easily right off the Vaparetto as others have remarked. You do need to follow the directions as one is easily and quickly lost in Venice's winding and tall alleys, charming later not so much when first arriving tired with suitcases. The front desk staff were consistently patient and very helpful, the staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. Our room was very clean, It had a jetted bath/shower, and views of rooftops, and the narrow street, at first disappointing, but I grew to enjoy it as you start to notice the varied balconies, shutters, potted plants. Generous breakfast was included with scrambled eggs, bacon and other cold meats, cheeses, greens, tomatoes, canned peaches, yogurts, dry cereals, breads, pastries, and fresh fruit. Many families stayed there as well as couples, the venue appeared to work well for both. Coffee, espresso, cappuccino, tea, cocoa served by the friendly server, as noted in another review, and at no additional fee. Any time you spend on how to read the street signs will not be wasted. I found the maps not that helpful, but looked for landmarks, and by the end of the second day was feeling more comfortable, very comfortable, moving from San Marco/Rialto to the hotel, a 15-20 min walk. Easy easy easy to get lost, which was never scary, Venice feels so safe, however, one helpful hint is to key to the posted (written on walls, usually in yellow, some added as hand written notes on arches--none consistent, but often enough to be helpful) main directions for the Rialto and San Marco, and then your closest vapporetto. Recommend San Marco visit early in the day, you will find a line by 0830, it opens at 0945, but worth it, and you are waiting in the shade, unlike later when the line is longer, and in the sun. Go right upstairs (before the crowds), it cost about five euros, but the view is stunning both of the cupola mosaics, and then outside, the grand canal and square. Another reason to stay at Ca' Zusto: it is close to a very wonderful restaurant, \"Trattoria Al Ponte Del Megio\" just a two minute easy walk from the hotel, get a table on the canal people watch while enjoying some of the best food Venice has to offer. Other: AIr conditioner worked very well and was adjusted easily. Elevator worked well to the second floor. A separate smaller elevator from second to third, I could not get it to work--but perhaps it was simply too slow and I did not wait long enough. This second one will fit only one person, and if in a wheelchair, would recommend you ck dimensions,feasibility. WiFi is free but only available on the first floor, the lounge (breakfast room) is lovely for this purpose as well as for reading and relaxing. Quite hotel, away from the bustle, but within easy walking distance to main sites. Lovely, would recommend.",

                "content": "We stayed here for two nights on a fourteen-day (seven-hotel) trip. We were very impressed by almost every element of this hotel - its location, design and luxuriousness. But we were extremely put-off by the non-functioning air-conditioning (and, in particular) the staff's (non-)response to it. The hotel is well located - quite close to the station and along the \"main drag\" between there and St Mark's Square. At least one other reviewer has recommended taking the ferry there along the Grand Canal, but we walked. The distance isn't a problem at all, and it's not hard to find, but there _are_ two bridges (with stairs) to cross on the way, so consider that if you're lugging suitcases. It's a very modern and renovated place (in an old building). It's listed as four stars and looks it. Quite luxurious, but small and a bit fancier than we needed. And not \"luxurious\" to us in the ways that we find most important. For example, the shower was tinier than most, and the fittings (though modern) don't work well in it. Breakfast was so-so. Nice to have proper coffee and fancy little jams. But the croissants and eggs were no better than places half this price. The only real inconvenience though was the AC - it didn't run, and we suspect the staff were lying about why. The room was quite warm (with not much of a breeze from the windows), and the air-conditioning either didn't work or wasn't turned on. Friends who'd just visited Venice warned us that might be the case - something about laws about the date they can start activating it...? But they also warned us the hotel would be liable to lie to us about the problem. That's pretty much exactly what happened. There were lots of excuses and no real action to resolve the issue - both signs (in our minds) that we were being lied to. We were able to live with no AC. But being misled really rubbed me the wrong way.",

The hotel is very conveniently located for the vaporetto, being a just a few steps from the nearest stop on the Grand Canal, and it is in walking distance of the railway station. Just around the corner there are some very good restaurants in Santa Croce, and yet its immediate surroundings are quiet and peaceful. The hotel itself is very stylish, an interesting old building decorated in modern style, and our room was large, luxurious and well equipped. All the staff were excellent, friendly and helpful. It wasn't expensive compared to other hotels of the same standard in Venice, and we would happily return if we get the chance.",

                "content": "My first thought about Maui Eldorado is that there must be great inconsistency in the condition of the units. Some of the reviews are fantastic, but our unit was not in good condition. It was actually somewhat disgusting. The entire unit needed painted (about 10 years ago) and baseboard work. We had water damage is both bathrooms and the bedroom. The tubs were missing large sections of porcelain and there were tiles missing and cracked everywhere. Counters were mildewed and missing tiles. Kitchen was just kind of old and yucky. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom was right above the bed and so loud and clanky we turned it off to sleep. Our deadolt didn't work, bathroom sink didn't drain and no lightbulb in outside doorway. On the plus side, the area was fantastic. We had a beautiful, large balcony with a view of the golf course and the ocean. It was amazing to sit out and view the scenery. We loved the cabana and beach area. The pool area was big, but very cold. Overall, we would not stay here again, unless we got one of the great units that other people seem to review favorably. So beware what you may end up with. By the way we were in the building closest to the lobby and room 204.",
