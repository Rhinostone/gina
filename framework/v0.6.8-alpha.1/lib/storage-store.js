/**
 * @module lib/storage-store
 * @description Thin factory that loads the connector-specific storage metadata
 * store from `<connectorsPath>/<connector>/lib/storage-store.js` and returns a
 * ready store for `lib/storage` — the `lib/job-store` / `lib/audit-store` /
 * `lib/render-cache-store` sibling for the object-storage layer (#STO1).
 *
 * The store holds the per-object metadata row (originalName, contentType,
 * size, createdAt) that backs `stat()` — and, since size tiering, the PAYLOAD
 * itself (`data`, a Buffer) for objects under the driver's `inlineThreshold`.
 * An implementation therefore needs a binary-safe field that round-trips
 * bytes exactly, and losing the store loses inline objects, not just their
 * metadata; file-backed objects keep their bytes in the driver's adapter.
 *
 * Since cas, a store backing a `cas` driver must ALSO implement the four
 * refcount verbs (`acquireRef`/`releaseRef`/`listZeroRefs`/`removeIfZero` —
 * contract in `lib/storage/src/meta-store.js`'s `StorageMetaStore` typedef,
 * including the per-key atomicity each owes and the multi-process sweep
 * residual). A `cas` driver refuses to build against a store lacking them;
 * `sharded` drivers need only the base four verbs.
 *
 * Do not call this directly — declare the backend in `config/connectors.json`,
 * point the driver's `settings.json` `storage.drivers.<name>.store` at that
 * entry name, and let `gna.js` wire it at boot (before the first `put()`, since
 * store adoption is once-only).
 *
 * NOTE: no connector ships a storage-store implementation yet — connector
 * backends are demand-gated (the `lib/audit-store` shipping order). Configuring
 * a driver's `store` today therefore refuses the boot with a clear message; the
 * embedded SQLite backend (no `store` key) is the v1 path. That embedded
 * default is documented single-process-per-driver-root: two bundles sharing one
 * root need a connector-backed store, which is exactly what this seam is for.

 * @param {string} connName - `connectors.json` entry name (referenced by `settings.json`'s
 *                            `storage.drivers.<name>.store`). The entry's `.connector` field
 *                            selects the implementation (a connector without a
 *                            `lib/storage-store.js` is rejected).
 * @returns {object}        - A `StorageMetaStore` instance (`set/get/remove/close`; rows may
 *                            carry an inline payload — see the typedef in
 *                            `lib/storage/src/meta-store.js` for the binary-safety contract).
 * @throws {Error}          - When the entry is missing, has no `connector` field, or the
 *                            connector has no storage-store implementation. `gna.js`
 *                            treats a throw as fatal — an explicitly configured store must
 *                            build, never degrade silently to the embedded backend, which
 *                            would put the metadata somewhere the operator did not ask for.
 *
 * @example
 *   // settings.json:    { "storage": { "drivers": { "assets": { "store": "assetsDb" } } } }
 *   // connectors.json:  { "assetsDb": { "connector": "sqlite", "file": "/data/assets-meta.db" } }
 *   var store = new StorageStore('assetsDb'); // done by gna.js at boot
