During the week of the 9th March, we stayed at this hotel for a few days. When we checked out, we drove direction Baton Rouge. As we arrived, we found out that my husband had lost his back bag with all documents, passport, computer, etc. somewhere... The recepcionist in Super 8 La Place helped us a lot. We were very nervous, and she even let us phone to New Orleans just to check if our bag was there. No news, but finally, we decided to drove back to New Orleans. As we arrived the recepcionist, Nimahs, helped us a lot! Security guy, Dal, also. But as they didnÂ´t know about the lost bag, we asked to check the security cameras. The responsible guy came, and checked the cameras with my husband. Thanks to that, the bag was found! Happy end of the history thanks to that people! No one accepted any tips from us. We surely will recomend Super 8 hotels from now on. On the other hand, I must say that this is not a well located hotel if you want to party every night in the French Quarter. But we thought it was a good choice, also thinking about prices, and because we had our own car.",

        "content": "We read reviews of motels in New Orleans before choosing this one based on good feedback from others. It turned out to be a good choice, for it was a comfortable stay and the staff obviously put a lot of effort into making it a quality establishment. When we left they even had staff doing work in the garden. The room itself was good, with two beds, a fridge and coffee maker. Amazingly, the wifi also worked in the room, which I found to be something of a rarity for places in this price range. The floor sloped slightly downwards, which was a bit odd, but it didn't matter at all. There is plenty of parking, even if the spaces are quite tight. The motel is equipped with a gym, which I didn't use, plus an outdoor pool, which looked quite good but was far too cold when I was there. The business center was very useful, for I was able to print out flight tickets. Breakfast was good (though waffles would enhance it!), but was packed away promptly at 9:30. It was good to fill up in the morning while watching the news before going into New Orleans for the day. That brings me to the location - it's not in an area that you'd want to walk around, but isn't too far from fast food places and is very close to the interstate, so it's easy to get into New Orleans itself. A lot of the motels in New Orleans are in this area. This is an impressive motel and I would happily stay here again if I was every lucky enough to be able to return to New Orleans.",

If you want to know what it looks like, go to youtube and search for Secrets Maroma honeymoon suite and that is it. Upon entering, we were taken immediately to the Preferred lounge for check in. We would have at least enjoyed seeing the lobby but were taken via golf cart before entering. We were offered a drink and towel and our concierge took us to our room for a tour. His name was Sabastian. Unlike others have mentioned, we used our conceirge and preferred club a great deal. It was like our own personal butler and personal bartender. There was never anyone there. We are beach people and used, walked and relaxed on the beach each day. Very uncrowded. We could not understand why the pools were so crowded. The beach was incredible as advertised. Service was incredible! We tipped a great deal, but really did not feel that things would be better or worse if we did not. A tip was treated with indifference at bars and restaurants. I struggled with this as since this is an all inclusive, I would have thought a tip would be greatly appreciated and would make a difference. there was a ton of people around and the only service complaint was that we had to ask all the time for something, not servers asking us. Overall, the restaurants and food was great. Oceana was our favorite followed by Il Patio and then Bordeaux was just not good. Why would you want to sit in a small, poorly air conditioned restaurant when you can sit outside enjoying the breeze at Oceana. Finally, the overall resort, service, beach, pools, room drinks, activities were all memorable. We would definitely return and do highly recommend. I hope whoever reads this goes to this resort and enjoys as much as my wife and I did.",

        "content": "My husband and I researched numerous resorts before settling on Secrets Maroma. I must say, some of the reviews were worrysome, but I am glad we went anyways. We had a brief trip 10-2-09 - 10-4-09, and my only issue is that we didn't have more time to enjoy paradise. Bugs - For us, there were not that bad. They gave us bug wipes, and we kept the screen door closed in our room if we were outside. The fogged around daily numerous times, so maybe they got a better handle it by the time we went... this was a non-issue for us. A/C - Not an issue at all. Our room was cold at times. Here is the deal... you must close your doors to have the A/C kick in. If you leave the doors open all day, it will get warm. The only places we thought the A/C was lacking some was at the World Cafe for Breakfast, and the lobby tended to be warm in the daytime, but not in the evenings. The swim out suite is well worth it. We really enjoyed the privacy of having our own area to swim. The concierge at our own building was so friendly and sweet. She truly would have done anything we needed, and asked us all the time if she could help. The resort overall was so well serviced. The food was excellent at Oceana, the lunch sit down at the Steakhouse by the pool and the breakfasts. This is really all we had time to eat. I would say the World Cafe buffet for dinner was not overly impressive... maybe impressive with the amount of food, but not the quality of food. I did not enjoy that as much. The drinks were so plentiful and awesome. Top shelf for sure. Enjoy!!! I would say that overall it was a wonderful way to spend our 10th anniversary. We will definitely go back and for longer. Don't let the other reviews worry you. Also, just as a side note, we used Cancun Transfers as our transfer. They were direct transfers for $82 roundtrip for 2. They drove us directly to our hotel in a transfer van, but picked up in a nice Suburban. For the price, you can't beat that. We felt that it was very reputable and safe.",

This was our first time at a Secrets resort. This hotel was amazing! We had no problems with our AC in our room. It was always a decent cool temperature, but I made sure to always leave the doors and shutters shut with the fan on full blast all week. It was always cool when we got back to our room. We had a swim-out suite which was great, but we only used it 3 of the 6 days we were there. You really didn't even need it, because of the two beautiful pools at the resort, but it was a nice extra! The beach was gorgeous, we always found a nice hut to lay under and they give you free snorkels to use for 2 hours, great for swimming with the awesome angelfish right off the beach. The pools were a little warm which I actually like. I hate getting into a cold pool. They were still very refreshing! And again, we could always find a spot to sit by the pools as well. The chefs walk around sporatically on the beach and around the pool with little snacks which were great! And the waitresses/waiters walk around to bring you drinks were awesome! The entire staff was SO friendly and welcoming. We were glad we brought $50 worth of singles to tip everyone, since they were excellent! The italian restaurant was our favorite. We went twice! The seaside grill for lunch was great also! My only complaint was the Mexican restuarant. We were there our first night hoping to get tacos or fajitas, but all they had was fancy & strange items on the menu, such as grasshopper salad and suckling pig. A big EW to us! We did go to the Spa, my husband loved his massage, but mine was just so-so. Other than that, the place was amazing and relaxing! We will defintily return!!!

As an American you are used to nicer hotels, but european hotels are....more like a bad Motel 6 experience to say the least. You put up with it because well.....You are IN VENICE! Or Paris or somewhere else spectacular. But, I was pleasantly surprised by our hotel. I must say that finding it was not easy, but wondering around in Venice is never a bad experience. The front desk staff were very nice and helpful. You will have to get an internet access code every 2 hours, but they had surprisingly good internet access. The rooms were very large compared to european standards and very clean. Our bathroom was also HUGE compared to european standards and we also had a large rain showerhead and a shower door! I was thrilled. Our room had french doors that opened onto a small cobble stone courtyard and a minifridge. They also had the biggest towels that I've ever seen in Italy. The location was wonderful. You just follow the signs to St. Mark's or Rialto and you can walk anywhere. We did get lost one night, but that was part of the fun of it. It is in a quite location but even in the back area's of Venice there are plenty of restaurants and shops right around the corner. I would definately stay here again.",

        "content": "Domina Home Ca' Zusto was an excellent choice for our four day stay in Venice. It is a small hotel in the San Croce district, deceptively nondescript from the outside, yet once inside, abundant marble, lovely staircases, warm and very lively decor, just minutes from San Marco and the Rialto bridge. We found it easily right off the Vaparetto as others have remarked. You do need to follow the directions as one is easily and quickly lost in Venice's winding and tall alleys, charming later not so much when first arriving tired with suitcases. The front desk staff were consistently patient and very helpful, the staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. Our room was very clean, It had a jetted bath/shower, and views of rooftops, and the narrow street, at first disappointing, but I grew to enjoy it as you start to notice the varied balconies, shutters, potted plants. Generous breakfast was included with scrambled eggs, bacon and other cold meats, cheeses, greens, tomatoes, canned peaches, yogurts, dry cereals, breads, pastries, and fresh fruit. Many families stayed there as well as couples, the venue appeared to work well for both. Coffee, espresso, cappuccino, tea, cocoa served by the friendly server, as noted in another review, and at no additional fee. Any time you spend on how to read the street signs will not be wasted. I found the maps not that helpful, but looked for landmarks, and by the end of the second day was feeling more comfortable, very comfortable, moving from San Marco/Rialto to the hotel, a 15-20 min walk. Easy easy easy to get lost, which was never scary, Venice feels so safe, however, one helpful hint is to key to the posted (written on walls, usually in yellow, some added as hand written notes on arches--none consistent, but often enough to be helpful) main directions for the Rialto and San Marco, and then your closest vapporetto. Recommend San Marco visit early in the day, you will find a line by 0830, it opens at 0945, but worth it, and you are waiting in the shade, unlike later when the line is longer, and in the sun. Go right upstairs (before the crowds), it cost about five euros, but the view is stunning both of the cupola mosaics, and then outside, the grand canal and square. Another reason to stay at Ca' Zusto: it is close to a very wonderful restaurant, \"Trattoria Al Ponte Del Megio\" just a two minute easy walk from the hotel, get a table on the canal people watch while enjoying some of the best food Venice has to offer. Other: AIr conditioner worked very well and was adjusted easily. Elevator worked well to the second floor. A separate smaller elevator from second to third, I could not get it to work--but perhaps it was simply too slow and I did not wait long enough. This second one will fit only one person, and if in a wheelchair, would recommend you ck dimensions,feasibility. WiFi is free but only available on the first floor, the lounge (breakfast room) is lovely for this purpose as well as for reading and relaxing. Quite hotel, away from the bustle, but within easy walking distance to main sites. Lovely, would recommend.",

        "content": "We stayed here for two nights on a fourteen-day (seven-hotel) trip. We were very impressed by almost every element of this hotel - its location, design and luxuriousness. But we were extremely put-off by the non-functioning air-conditioning (and, in particular) the staff's (non-)response to it. The hotel is well located - quite close to the station and along the \"main drag\" between there and St Mark's Square. At least one other reviewer has recommended taking the ferry there along the Grand Canal, but we walked. The distance isn't a problem at all, and it's not hard to find, but there _are_ two bridges (with stairs) to cross on the way, so consider that if you're lugging suitcases. It's a very modern and renovated place (in an old building). It's listed as four stars and looks it. Quite luxurious, but small and a bit fancier than we needed. And not \"luxurious\" to us in the ways that we find most important. For example, the shower was tinier than most, and the fittings (though modern) don't work well in it. Breakfast was so-so. Nice to have proper coffee and fancy little jams. But the croissants and eggs were no better than places half this price. The only real inconvenience though was the AC - it didn't run, and we suspect the staff were lying about why. The room was quite warm (with not much of a breeze from the windows), and the air-conditioning either didn't work or wasn't turned on. Friends who'd just visited Venice warned us that might be the case - something about laws about the date they can start activating it...? But they also warned us the hotel would be liable to lie to us about the problem. That's pretty much exactly what happened. There were lots of excuses and no real action to resolve the issue - both signs (in our minds) that we were being lied to. We were able to live with no AC. But being misled really rubbed me the wrong way.",

The hotel is very conveniently located for the vaporetto, being a just a few steps from the nearest stop on the Grand Canal, and it is in walking distance of the railway station. Just around the corner there are some very good restaurants in Santa Croce, and yet its immediate surroundings are quiet and peaceful. The hotel itself is very stylish, an interesting old building decorated in modern style, and our room was large, luxurious and well equipped. All the staff were excellent, friendly and helpful. It wasn't expensive compared to other hotels of the same standard in Venice, and we would happily return if we get the chance.",

        "content": "My first thought about Maui Eldorado is that there must be great inconsistency in the condition of the units. Some of the reviews are fantastic, but our unit was not in good condition. It was actually somewhat disgusting. The entire unit needed painted (about 10 years ago) and baseboard work. We had water damage is both bathrooms and the bedroom. The tubs were missing large sections of porcelain and there were tiles missing and cracked everywhere. Counters were mildewed and missing tiles. Kitchen was just kind of old and yucky. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom was right above the bed and so loud and clanky we turned it off to sleep. Our deadolt didn't work, bathroom sink didn't drain and no lightbulb in outside doorway. On the plus side, the area was fantastic. We had a beautiful, large balcony with a view of the golf course and the ocean. It was amazing to sit out and view the scenery. We loved the cabana and beach area. The pool area was big, but very cold. Overall, we would not stay here again, unless we got one of the great units that other people seem to review favorably. So beware what you may end up with. By the way we were in the building closest to the lobby and room 204.",

        "content": "As others have said, great location. Short walking distance to the Sheraton and Black Rock. Not that far of a walk to Whaler's Village either. We jogged next to the cart path for some exercise over to the village. Parking garage is in the middle, we were in unit I-201, right next to the garage with a partial golf course view, yet it was booked as a 1 bedroom garden view. The unit is huge for what you pay, 2 beds (we only used one), and a big living room area, plus the patio. Only cons I have is there is no work out facility. If you want to work out, you'll have to pay to use a facility. We jogged along the golf course (as many others do), did some pushups, and swam laps in the pool located on top of the garage instead. We also stayed 2 nights at the Kapalua Villas as a splurge and liked Eldorado better. The Villas were fancy smancy, but for the money, we thought the extra space and fancy stuff wasn't necessary. The location of Eldorado makes it the winner. A clean (firm) bed and shower area is what you're looking for in these places. This one had some mildew on the shower head, so do the Villas, but I can over look that and did mention it to the staff and my followup survey. Both beds were clean and firm here. Black Rock is the best snorkel location, and this hotel is right there. Don't worry about the views. Garden view is fine, and your view will be of a golf course no matter what you pick, even if it's a garden view. Some units do see the ocean, but you're gong to see that in person any way. So if you're on a budget and don't care about the view, the garden view is going to work and you'll be surprised.",

The Eldorado is close to the villas and reasonabley priced. The bed was nice and comfy, we had a full kitchen, dining table. The bathroom was nothing special, but it was clean. We had a great balcony with a veiw of the pool. This property is on a golf course so the water views are limited, but it is still beautiful. There are nice cabana's on the beach to use. Our only complaint is that the hours on the cabanas are only til 5:30. You can easily walk to the beach or whalers village, but if you don't feel like it, there are shuttles available to each.

        "content": "We stayed at the Maui El Dorado for three nights of our nine night Hawaii trip. This condo complex was in a great location and an excellent value. The remainder of our stay was at the Grand Wailea so we were not looking for an ultra luxury location while on Kaanapali. This was our first time to stay at a condo complex and were happy with our decision. The location was easily found by our GPS located in the heart of the Kaanapali Resort area, right near the beach. (There is a section of the golf course between the hotel and beach / cabana) The condo is adjacent to Black Rock and the Sheraton. Self parking is $7, which some people were not happy with but I was pleased that the complex does not have a resort fee, which seems to run rampant in Hawaii. We arrived very late due to flight delays and were greeted by the night security guard Randy was very welcoming and took us to our condo and even assisted with our heavy luggage. (Dive gear). There is a central parking garage that always had plenty of space. The condo we were in for the first night was well appointed but unfortunately the curtains were sheer and did not block out any light. (they should consider making this a standard requirement of all the units) If we wanted to rise early every day it would not have been a problem, but since we were on vacation we wanted to be able to sleep in a bit. We went down to the front desk and she kindly gave us the option of a few more units to check out. We selected J120 which was a direct view of the ocean over the golf course. Very well appointed and comfortable. They even took care of transferring out luggage while we were out. Check in was quick and easy and our luggage arrived in our room promptly. The front desk person even gave us a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. I think that this was great customer service. The units are not ultra plush, maybe a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The complex has at least two pools, nothing spectacular, but nice enough for a quick lounge when you do not want to head to the beach. The beach and private cabana as well as Black Rock (great snorkeling) are about a 7 minute walk from the complex and is a really nice perk. I think that the beach is nicer than that of the Sheraton. The cabana has a nice deck with loungers, towels, seat backs for the beach. Though there are not umbrellas available at the beach, there are many nice trees along the dune line if you are looking for shade. The cabana also has a full stove, refrigerator, and sink area. This is a great touch that allows you to bring your drinks, snacks, lunch, whatever while hanging out at the beach. (The cabana was being remodeled and should be complete by now) Though this condo complex lacks the Disney-esque pools of some of the mega resort hotels, we would come back here in a heart beat. It was very centrally located in the Kaanapali area. You could walk to the shops at Whalers village in about a 12 minute casual stroll and easy to find. (Though if you come back at night it can be hard to find the walkways across the golf course......make sure to pay attention when heading out for the night.) The complex has a small lobby with an activity booking agent and a convenience store. There is a nice casual service restaurant in a shopping center right across the street. The rooms had nicely appointed full kitchens, acceptable bathrooms, washer, dryer, King or Queen bed, Couch, dining table, and balcony with chairs. It seems most of the units had 27\" CRT TV's....I am sure owners will gradually upgrade the TV's. The units have free internet, though it is hard wired and not wifi. (If we were staying for a full week we might consider bringing a cheap wireless router) Housekeeping provided refresh service each day and was very prompt to come to our unit the day that we called for service when we had not yet seen them. All of the staff we ran across during out stay was friendly and willing to help when asked for assistance. We stayed at the Sheraton next door last year and for about twice the price I think we would just come back to the El Dorado....we would rather spend the money on activities and found that the location of the El Dorado is excellent. Though the grounds at the Sheraton were more stellar we felt that the rooms at the El Dorado were just as nicely appointed and it was nice to have the kitchen and laundry facilities. We would definitely stay here again.",

The staff were helpful and friendly, the accommodation is good value and the beach to our mind is one of the best in the world. This is the place to go to relax. The complex is quiet and low key. The pools may be basic but how often can you go to a place and get a whole pool to yourself. The units are spacious and airy, yes they do vary in quality so do your research. The only area of improvement could have been a really thorough cleaning of our unit half way through our stay. As we were there 17 days the bathroom mirrors and sinks could have done with a really thorough clean, same with the kitchen. Having said that I could have asked and I am confident it would have been done, the housekeeping did a great job of keeping us well supplied with towels and amenities. We recommend using the farmers markets for fresh produce and the 'Fish Market' north of the Eldorado in a strip mall just past 'Times\" supermarket. Goofy Foot surf school in Lahainia did a great job getting this family surfing for the first time and we would do it again. The snorkeling at Black Rock closest to the cabana (not the Sheraton side) is good and not crowded, we often saw turtles. Gazebos near Napilli beach is great for breakfast but get there early or you will be waiting a long time. Special thanks to Ruby and MaryAnn who helped with our bookings and were always so kind and helpful. We will undoubtedly be back again. Williams family (Portland OR)",

        "content": "Was pleased with our stay at the Eldorado. As has been pointed out before, there is variability among the units, so some may be better or worse than ours. We reserved a studio via Orbitz which was a good size, approx. 700 sf. Room was clean, furniture and appliances were in decent shape (not new, but not old either). Dishes and utensils were provided and were decent. As for the location, I find the \"15 minute walk to the beach\" claims to be a bit exaggerated. It's more like a 5-minute walk to the beach. It's not any different than walks to the beach from your room at one of the mega-resort type hotels (the ones with lots of buildings, long hallways, waits for elevators, and strategic paths meandering past shops and concessions). The golf course is between the rooms and the ocean, so the walk is not in a straight line, which may make it feel longer, but it is literally 5 minutes max. The beach was nice and pretty open. Great for sitting or laying out, though there is much better snorkeling next door at the Sheraton (which is signed as a public beach). Nobody said anything to us when we brought our Outrigger towels through the Sheraton grounds to the beach to snorkel. It's probably about a 10-minute walk from your Eldorado room to the Sheraton beach. What was annoying was that the Eldorado has a number of nickel-and-dime fees. Fees for making toll-free calls, fees for in-room coffee (first one per stay is free, additional is extra), charges for laundry detergent (again, first bottle per stay is free, additional is extra). There was even a charge to use the safe, and if you declined it, they asked you to sign a release form at checkin. This doesn't exactly give the visitor a warm-and-fuzzy on arrival. If it were up to me, I'd rather they comp the coffee and safe, and charge for detergent. That would bring them in line with normal hotel standards. The Internet was free, though, which was nice (and fast). It is with a cable, though, not wifi. There's a Safeway and Longs in town, just a few miles down the street to pick up anything you need, along with several dining options. Overall, we were pleased with the value for the money and would definitely stay here again.",

        "content": "We had to stay in Ka'anapali area for business and picked the Outrigger because this chain had always provided excellent condo accomodations in the past and the Maui Eldorado was no exception. We had a 1 bedroom partial ocean view unit that had recently been upgraded, full tile floor, big furnished lanai and everything we needed to feel at home for a few days. The garage parking seemed safe and secure, but the one caution would be this property did not seem handicap friendly (access to most units involved steps or a steep walkway up or down). I had worried about traffic noise as the complex is just downhill from the highway but it was quiet, quiet, quiet! We used the pool deck grills 2 nights and had the whole area and it's ocean view to ourselves. It was an easy walk down to the beach or shopping and restaurants at Whaler's Village, and next door to Round Table Pizza and C'J's Deli for quick meals.",

We love the Cabana and not having to drag towels, chairs, etc. is great. Its a short walk to the Whaler's Village Complex and there's a free shuttle we used everyday to haul our \"gifts\" back to our unit. I had no problem with parking and asked for the local papers delivered each morning. No problem. House keeping did a fine job and very friendly. As for the BBQ's, our unit, J210 (studio) had its own and we used it every other night. Check in/out was quick and painless. There is a small convience store next to the lobby which we found priced a little more than the Safeway (5 minutes away) but great for the forgotten bottle of wine or sixpack or whatever. Our unit, J210 was great! Really nice walk-in shower with optional overhead shower head. Free wireless. comfy bed. A/C which we didn't need. All-in-all. Great time was had. Highly recommend the morning whale watch with the Gemini outfit.",

They rated K112 as 4 star -yeah right - I don't think so. Maybe 3 star but more likely 2.5 star. If you have kids, this is an ok place to stay. Everything worked and we used the kitchen to make a lot of meals but this place needs updating in a big, bad way. Oh and we asked for our room to have a door so that we could shut the door on the bedroom when the kids went to sleep. Not sure what was so hard about comprehending that but we didn't get a door to the bedroom so we listened to our twin 1 year old boys scream themselves to sleep. Good times. The pools are ok - not very busy. The beach is great when there's no torrential rain storms going on. Whaler's Village is close enough to walk to, which is nice and Lahaina is a quick drive. The location is great but many of the rooms need to be rennovated. My husband's parents stayed in K200 and although it is a large suite, it needs to be rennovated as well.",

        "content": "We just got back from 5 days in Maui at the Outrigger El Dorado- 02/02/07-02/07/07. It was 3 adults- and we booked a 1 bedroom garden view condo- well, as I read on this site before we went, all the condos are individually owned, and therefore are all a little different. The first one they put us in was pretty bad, the decor was tired and dirty, but the biggest surpise was that while they called it a \"1 bedroom condo\" - it was really more of large room with a partial length wall between the beds and living room area, but no real separation or privacy of the sleeping and living/cooking area. I consider that a studio, and I did see several of these condos. Not what I had in mind at all when booking a \"1 bedroom condo\" for 1 couple and one single adult traveler!! After looking at 4 available rooms, we ended up in a great 1 bedroom partial ocean view condo in with a fully separate bedroom with 2 queen beds, a fold out couch in the living room, and 2 full bathrooms which was a real bonus. Kitchen was small but clean and up to date, and this room was just behind the lobby area so great for parking up front. We were in K204, great ocean view, nice big balcony- and we also saw and liked K104 which had the same layout. This hotel has a great beach which was never crowded, is a 5 min walk to the shops and restaurants in Whalers Village. Main pool was also quiet and had nice BBQ's there as well. If you are shopping for food, I thought the \"STAR MARKET\" just up the road towards Kapalua about 5 min was much better quality and stocked than the Safeway down the road to Lahaina. We got the best fresh local mahi mahi there and that on the BBQ as you watch the sunset from your balcony is pretty great! We ate out at SANSEI in Kapalua for sushi and it was quite good. This is a great condo style set up for familys or couples, and its so nice to be away from the crowds at all the hotels and condos along the beach by whalers village which gets pretty packed, and that is not my idea of relaxing! One last thing, if you are heading over soon, do find a whale watching trip, we did and it was a great experience! I will go back to this hotel for sure!",

We try to always stay at Outrigger or Ohana resorts when we are in Hawaii because of their liberal policies towards airline employees. We arrived late night and had booked a partial ocean view one bedroom condo. The condo they put us in was not partial oceanview but it was a 2 bedroom and seemed to be larger then our own house back home. We found out the next day that that was the only condo available when we checked in and needed to move as the owners were coming to stay. The entire staff was very apologetic and accomodating. The next day when we returned to the condo we found a large gift basket waiting for us and a card from the manager. The hotel overall had beautiful grounds and we loved the tiled pool. The beach was a bit of a walk but not more then 10 minutes and was well worth it. We would definately stay here again.",

We have stayed at Outrigger properties before on Kauai so we were extremely dissapointed when we went home. The decor was outdated in the room. The main pool above the parking garage was just a cement pond with water with absolutely no Hawaiian charms at all. In a previous post I agree with the person who said the bathrooms were dark and old. We stayed in G building. On the 3rd night there I heard rumbling in our kitchen. Somebody had eaten thru a plastic bag of food. Well when we mentioned that there was a 3rd party in our room and by the bite marks it was very large they said they couldn't move us for a day and not even a sense of \"we are sorry.\" When they did get us a new room they wouldn't even help us move to K building which wasn't close. I even got some snide comments from the staff \"Oh you are the one with the rodent\" and then a chuckle. The manager admitted to me that they knew of a problem in Building G that is why they had an exterminator there the day I found our roommate. They offered to move us to building H but I refused considering it was fumigate the first 2 days of our stay. We have been to Hawaii 3 times in 6 years and this was the worst place we stayed at by far.",

Don't expect a typical 5 star style Suite and Spa Hotel. I would give it 3.5 - 4 stars with great location and very helpful staff so if you consider this as a 3.5 - 4 star hotel when booking and you are happy with the room rates, then you certainly won't be dissapointed.",

But the best hotel for us was the Best Western Premier Regency Suites, and that's high praise since we really enjoyed the other hotels we stayed at. We stayed here for 4 nights. The location is fabulous - it's on Akbiyik Caddesi, which is a street full of cafes, lovely restaurants offering street-side tables in summer, and boutique hotels. It's a five minute walk to Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque, seven minutes to the Topkapi Saray, and just round the corner from the Arasta Bazar, which is a smaller, less frenzied, and less confusing version of the Grand Bazar, and no pressure from any of the shopkeepers. The waterfront is five minutes away by cab, and Taksim about 20 minutes away. The hotel is small - 16 rooms - but has all the conveniences you would expect, like an elevator, ground floor restaurant serving meals all day long, and even its own hammam and spa! The rooms are great - we had three rooms (401, 403 and 404) on the fourth floor - and are huge, particularly by Istanbul standards. The fittings and furnishings are of very high quality - super comfortable beds, sofas and sitting area, two desks, LCD TV mounted on the wall, room safe, minibar, etc. Perfect to come home to after a long day's sightseeing! Free wi-fi was a bonus, also there is a laptop guests can use, plus a printer downstairs. There's a beautiful rooftop on the fifth floor with views of the Marmara Sea on one side and the Blue Mosque on the other. By the way, some other reviewers had commented on the noise from the call to prayer. Our rooms faced the street, and we had no noise issues at all - the windows are double glazed, and the most we heard was a light murmur one night. Considering it's such a lively street, it was amazingly quiet. The hotel staff was so kind and caring - any requests we had were attended to promptly. The girl at the front desk even told us not to exchange money at the hotel as we could get a better rate outside! Whenever we took a taxi, they would come outside and give the address to the driver in Turkish, and one time when we were taking a cab back to the hotel and the driver was trying to overcharge us when we reached, she actually came outside and yelled at him, and voila! that was the end of his overcharging attempts! Breakfast every day was very good - huge selection of fruits, yogurt, cheeses and eggs cooked to order. Overall, we felt it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at, and can highly recommend it. We are planning to return to Turkey next year, and will stay here again for sure. For large, well appointed rooms, personalized service and great location, you can't do any better!",

The room was spottlesly clean and had extra beds for both our children and the location is perfect for visiting the main sights of Istanbul. However, a couple of warnings. First, a suite in Turkey doesn't mean multiple rooms, merely a single bedroom with ensuite bathroom. Secondly, the deluxe suites (I don't think they have a standard class, the alternative is an executive suite) offer a view of a brick wall just over a metre from the windows. Not that we were there to sit looking out the window, but you couldn't even tell if it was cloudy or sunny without craning your neck out the window. Warning's out the way, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel - just be aware what you're booking.",

When we arrived at the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel. It was very clean and and luxurious. Bathroom was large. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommended this hotel to any one looking for a 4 to 5 star accommodation at a reasonable price. The location is very close all old town attractions.",

        "content": "A hotel suite is normally means a connected series of rooms to be used together and not a single room as was provided. I booked what was described as Suite Executive Room and expected what I would normally get from a suite: a separate bedroom and other living area. I wanted a larger room because I was staying 8 days. I got s single room - clearly not a suite - at what was really an outrageous price. This really is misleading advertising and not acceptable. The street where the hotel is located has many other hotels and hostels as well as bars and restaurants. It is fairly downmarket with any walk down the street resulting in being accosted by touts for each. The hotel has a basic restaurant serving uninspiring food. The breakfast buffet is limited and poor. There is a very small range of breakfast cereals and fruit and some poor cold meat products that are really only suitable for feeding to the many cats in the area. There is a top floor open-air balcony but, unlike other hotels, this has no awnings or canopies and so is quite unusable in the hot afternoons. There is a separate smaller balcony area off the fourth floor but this is unfinished. There was building work and associated noise that went on until around 8:00 pm some days but this was not mentioned anywhere on the hotelâ€™s Web site. And on a final note; rooms were typically not made-up until after 4;00 pm. When we arrived back one day after 4:00 pm we were told our room was not cleaned and were offered a drink while we waited. These drinks appeared on our bill at check-out. I have to say that my experience with this hotel is so completely at odds with that of others that I feel something is fundamentally wrong. I selected the hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews and, based on this experience, have a significantly reduced trust in reviews on this site. The very poor value for money and overall experience invalidates any minor saving graces such as cleanliness.",

The neighborhood had easy access to the train station as well as the subway. We walked everywhere while in Rome. When we traveled by train from Rome to Sorrento and back to Rome from Florence this made walking from the train station very easy. When I go back to Rome I will definitely stay here again. We stayed at the Hotel Sonya on the first leg of our trip, and at the Hotel Opera Roma on our way back. Even though I enjoyed them both, I prefer the Hotel Sonya, because it was a smaller hotel.",

The second room had more space and a larger bathroom too. Nice breakfast, excellent coffee and very friendly staff. The only thing we noticed was the noise level in the breakfast room by the staff clearing away crockery. Other than this, it is an ideally located hotel and very good value for money. I was impressed by the internet service available and the loan of a notebook for our use in the room. I would recommend this hotel and would use it again when we next visit the very beautiful city of Rome.",

The room was recently (and quite lavishly) refurbished and quite spacious (even with an additional bed for our 14 year old son). The bathroom was huge. There was free wireless internet access from the room, The hotel seems to be a smaller off shoot from a nearby hotel and so there aren't a lot of staff. But those that there are, were friendly and very helpful. The manager Reza seemed to be everywhere and very willing to help. When my wife enquired about a coffee shop when we first arrived after a long flight - Reza was back with a cappuccino almost immediately. Breakfast was basic but more than adequate. The hotel is centrally located near to the main railway station - but off a quiet street. And the cost was very reasonable compared with other places we stayed in Italy. We would definitely stay there again.",

Tourgay and his staff truly bend over backwards to ensure that your stay is comfortable. The property has no evelator but is only 3 stories in height - even though I travelled with school aged children this was not an issue. The hotel staff were very helpful in unloading and loading baggage from our vehicle. The rooms were very clean, hot water was plentiful and the kitchenette was well stocked with all the essential for food preparation. There is a 24 hour grocery store right next door and the metro is about a 5 minute walk away. Very close to McGill and would be an excellent base for anyone moving a student to that instituation in the city. We stayed in a room with a king bed and pullout queen sofabed. The queen sofabed was suprisingly comfortable as these types of sleeping arrangements can be touch and go depending on the hotel. Also included were 2 plasma TV's and free parking through a little laneway behind the hotel. The hotel is an excellent value when used as a home away from home. I would stay here again without question.",

Breakfast was good and they went out of their way to make sure everyone was finished and had all they needed before closing up the breakfast area. The room was clean and comfortable. There was a little wear showing in the bathroom but nothing unacceptable. The pool was warm but only 3 1/2 feet deep. They had a hot tub and a workout room. The location was good but a little bit hard to find if you didn't have a printed map with directions. With the directions we had no problems finding it. You had to wind through a residential area and appartment complexes. It was right near the Gallaria mall and close to the freeway. One evening my two children and I arrived back at the hotel probably about 11:30pm and we were approached in the parking lot by a nicely dressed man saying he and his wife were stranded back on the highway and his family was in Ohio and they needed money to stay in a neighboring hotel. They were short $16.00 and could I help them out. I gave him $20.00 and hurried into the hotel. Legitimate? who knows, well probably not but I figured 20.00 was worth there being no scene or other problems with my kids there. I didn't really feel unsafe and the parking lot was very well lit. This hotel is directly next to an Embassy Suites and a Motel 6 so there are other hotels in the area. We would probably stay here again but I would be ready to get inside the building right away after parking!",

        "content": "My husband and I just spent 4 nights at this hotel and overall we were very disappointed. Mostly from two things - our air conditioner was SOOO loud, it sounded like an airplane engine. We were going to change rooms but figured they would probably all be that loud. Not only was it loud but also rattled - so annoying. But that wasn't the worst part, we got up on our second morning and walked to our car and see some people standing around their car and they asked if our car was ok because their truck's passenger window had been smashed out and items were stolen. Luckily our car was fine but we felt really bad for them. Then the hotel never cleaned up the glass, it was still there when we left this morning! The location of the hotel is not great. It is confusing to find, confusing to get on I-75N from, and there is a sketchy apartment complex right behind it with some creepy/sketchy people walking through the parking lot at all hours. No wonder you have to use your key card to access the front lobby after 9pm! The only good thing about the place, the price and the room layout. You have a separate living room area and separate bedroom area. Too bad the air conditioning is only in the bedroom area so that made it difficult for the living room to get cool enough. Oh, one last thing, you should bring an eye mask if you want to sleep in, the windows didn't have heavy curtains to keep the room dark. Only sheer curtains, I couldn't believe it. Anyway, I hope this helps you decide if you want to stay here or not. I would personally suggest staying a little more north - like at the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Select (along 75 in Richardson).",

        "content": "Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating, though most of the housekeeping staff does not speak English. Room was clean except for one spot on the bedspread but I never use hotel bedspreads anyway, so it wasn't a big deal for me. Everything else was fresh and clean. Entire hotel is non-smoking which is a major plus for me. Pets are allowed with a deposit but if people actually take their pets there, you'd never know it. There was no smell at all nor did I have any issues with allergies from pet dander. Beds and pillows were VERY comfortable. Rooms and hallways were very quiet. We never heard our neighbors or any outside noise at all. Windows do open but it was too warm for us to take advantage of that. When we checked in the AC had already been turned on for us so the room was nice and cool - perfect after such a long drive. Hot tub and pool area were very clean and no too many people used them. However, the chlorine smell was VERY strong and caused some eye and allergy irritation for some of us - even those who didn't get into the water. We were able to prop open the emergency exit door to the outside and it got a little better. Room has a fairly low ceiling so if they used better ventilation or had a higher glass ceiling, it might not be so bad. Also, there is a lot of echo in that room - more than you'd think - and it's hard to carry on a conversation, even in the hot tub. Continenal breakfast included make-your-own-waffles and the waffle iron was shaped like Texas, which everyone thought was cool. Also had a limited selection of bagels, english muffins, bread for toast. Bananas and apples were the fruit choices. Small boxes of Kelloggs cereals available. Also had sausage biscuits, breakfast burritos and sausage/pancake corndogs that could be microwaved. No microwave in the rooms but the breakfast room was open 24 hours so you could use that if needed. Several restaurants and fast food places close by. Also not far from both Kroger and Walmart Supercenter. Overall, not a place I'd go if I was looking for a vacation where you relax at the hotel- rooms are fairly small but adequate for sleeping. Double queen room does not have enough room for an added rollaway, for example. But for an on-the-go vacation where all you need is a clean comfy place to sleep, a decent breakfast and that's convenient to everything, this is a great choice.",

        "content": "The hotel has a lot of perks for families traveling on a budget. The breakfast buffet and evening receptions (Mon. - Thur.) we wonderful and saved us a ton on food. We brought our dog with us and the hotel was very pet friendly. The cleaning staff was also very diligent and our room never went a day without being serviced, even when we didn't remove the \"do not disturb\" sign until 3pm. The fitness center was a big plus too. The only downside I'd give to the hotel is that the walls are kind of thin and you can hear everything in the hallway and that the internet was a little slow. But as far as hotels go, I think those things are minor. We will be staying at this hotel again when we are in the Dallas area.",

The Good: Staff went out of teir way to accomodate. Stayed two nights and each day departed before the 7 am breakfast. Staff made sure cont breakfast was available prior to dearture. Hotel and grounds were spotless. Never saw cleaning staff and room was always clean. Starbucks,CV (?) Pharmacy, hamburger an sanwich shop adjacent to property. Full kitchen. Extra storage space for your gear inside of the hotel The bad: Well not really, but there was a house with burgler bars next to the property. Parking areas well lit and no security threats noted. Will need to drive to most restaurants. The Ugly: none noted. Summary: Stay with pleasure. Easy freeway access yet no freeway noise. If the hotel is dog friendly (?) lot's of area to walk. Rooms were spacious and updaed tv's. Excellent value.",

        "content": "My friend booked this hotel for his business event in Dallas and I went along for the ride. We were actually kind of excited about this hotel because it was such a great deal and being a Hyatt we were expecting great quality and service. After the 4+ hour drive we check in and get into our rooms, ready to wash off a bit and realize that the water coming out of the faucets is a dark brown color and smells of sewage. I was mortified. We checked both sinks and the shower and actually got video footage. Then we called the front desk and asked if they were aware of any problems expecting them to be apologetic and maybe even having us move to another hotel. No reaction. They said they'd send someone up to our room. No one ever came so I went downstairs to try to find some potable water. When I turned on the faucet in the ladies down stairs-- same thing! Disgusting. I asked the front desk person if they knew of any plumbing problems and she said no but called her manager. When she was finally able to track someone down by phone he said that yes by the way they had shut the water off earlier in the day and this happens. We should let the water run a while and it should be fine. We never received an apology. No one ever checked up on us to find out if the situation had been resolved. Nothing. Very, very disappointed. And disgusted. How does this happen? Really?",

The problem was fixed very quickly.The room was clean although in no way shape or form a suite in my opinion. There is a wall that separates the bedroom from the sitting area and I found the room the smallest suite I've ever seen. The kitchen is functional with small fridge, microwave, and stove. However, the problem is insulation. We heard every noise going on outside from the construction, the people upstairs, the people walking by outside in the hallways. There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing! The breakfast buffet was decent as long as you don't mind warming it up. There are very few restaurants nearby and the staff is not very knowledgable. I would not return but may be economical choice for business travelers",

This time I had the worst room I've ever had. It had one tiny window that overlooked the construction site (the hotel is expanding and the new part is scheduled for completion next spring). The window was tiny and dirty so the room seemed claustrophobic. It only had a double bed. There was no closet, just a wardrobe that was not large enough to hold a week's worth of business clothes. But the hotel is clean, pretty quiet, and the employees are, to a person, pleasant and accomodating. The restaurant, Social, is good but probably not worth the prices!",

The rooms have the decor, and simplistic layout traditional of a European Hotel. The shower / water pressure is \"ala\" Germany where there is ample water pressure and flow. The Seinfield Episode where Kramer has illegal shower heads comes to mind because it is easy to want to stay in the shower for long periods of time (just don't wash the produce off in the shower)! The Aveda amenties are superior to those that you would find in typical chain hotels. Although the Lumen is not on par with the other Kimpton Hotel nearby, it is a very good value and has a great location and service.",

Also, my room was in the same hallway as the management offices, so during the day, there is a lot of talking and conversing back and forth across the offices, which makes it very noisy as well. For some reason, they don't close the doors to the management offices. Also, be aware that their restaurant doesn't open for lunch, so you have to grab something elsewhere for lunch. It is a pet friendly hotel, and they have a lovely dog that greets guests at the front desk...but be warned if you have pet allergies.

I found WorldQuest online by doing a little research and was so glad we switched. First of all, the facility is beautiful and the pool was a huge highlight for our boys. Staff was very pleasant and check-in and out was a breeze. We stayed in a 3 bedroom unit which suited all of our needs and having the kitchen and our own separate bathrooms was a joy! Very quiet facility. Nice to not hear the noise from the other rooms and nice to be away from the crowds of people after a full day at disney. The shuttle service was superb and free! Insiders tip - we had an amazing taxi driver on the days we did not take the shuttle. His name is Van{not sure how to spell it} and he drives a van! He was one of the highlights of our trip. He was a super driver and took such good care of us. Drove us out to the Space Center{45 minute drive each way} and was there promptly to pick us up. Took us to a great restaurant for dinner{Golden Corral} great food and cheap! He is such a nice, hard working man. Taxi drivers must pay to lease their vehicles and he pays $1500.00 per week for his van. Gas not included. He works over 18 hours a day. So if you are going to Orlando, please request him. He is a sweetheart!!!",

        "content": "I want to provide both the pros and the cons of the resort: Pros: 1. The rooms were lovely and spacious. 2. Well decorated 3. Felt as if you were in an apartment or condo 4. The kitchen was well stocked if you had a desire to cook or have meals without going out. 5. The pool area was nice. 6. A gated property where your parking tag as displayed to enter and exit the facility 7. Breakfast was provided. 8. Excellent proximity to the parks 9. A safe for valuables. 10. Screened in patio that allowed our granddaughter to be outside without the fear of her falling over. Cons: 1. I requested an early check-in. I called upon landing at 10:30 and was told to call again at 2:00. I arrived at the property at 3:00 and waited in a rather small lobby with several other disgruntled families waiting for their room. Was not assigned a room until closer to 4:00. There was only one person checking in a line of people. When he asked the person behind me to go to the next window I informed him I was already told by her that she was \"busy.\" 2. I asked to be in a building near the front of the property since my husband has a health condition and I am always concerned about an ambulance. We were placed in Building 6 near the back of the property. 3. We had a two bedroom unit. The toilet in one of the bathrooms did not work properly, and the other bathroom's toilet had a broken handle. I called, but they were never fixed properly. 4. One evening we came back rather late to find our door \"unlocked.\" Our three year old granddaughter pulled on the handle before we inserted the key and it just opened. 5. I called about the lock but nobody showed up when we asked. The next day we called again and I was told they would send someone \"right out.\" After waiting we left with the hope that our belongings would not be disturbed we left for the park as nobody arrived. 6. The day of check out, we were awakened at 9:20 to make sure we were leaving. At 10:50, another knock on the door asking if we were leaving. I said yes, within 30 minutes. I asked if I had to check out and she said \"no, just leave the key cards.\" While waiting for my daughter to finish, I stripped the sheets from the bed, vacuumed the carpet, swept the kitchen floor, my husband emptied the trash, placed the towels in one area, etc. and took our bags to the van. At 11:20 the phone rang and a woman â€œcheck-out time is at 11:00.â€� By then, I was livid. I proceeded to tell her I was aware of the time and she was the THIRD person who asked when we were leaving and rattled off the requests that I had and were not fulfilled. I also told her I began cleaning the room while waiting to leave. She told me â€œquit taking it personally.â€� I replied I am not taking it personally but I am insulted that this is the third notice for a twenty minute delay. Two of the notices began prior to the check-out time, I said when I get home; I will post how I was treated on Trip Advisor. Her response was â€œdo what you have to do.â€� She was unapologetic the entire time. She also asked how she is supposed to know that I had been contacted twice before, I suggested they improve their communication system.",

        "content": "We stayed here in December 2011 based on a recommendation from a friend. I had asked (via Facebook) for any recommendations for a condo to stay while in the Disney area. We were traveling with our two young children, my mother, and my sister, and thought a condo would be a better option than the two hotel rooms we had booked nearby. After speaking to my friend and thoroughly researching the property here in tripadvisor, we decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did - we stayed three nights in a three bedroom in Building 3 and were very comfortable. We had a couple of minor issues - the kitchen sink was emitting a strange smell and there were some items under beds and the couch that likely could have been cleaned up with a more thorough cleaning crew. We didn't make a big deal of the sink since we were rarely at the condo, though I am sure they would have at least checked it out if we had called it in. We just returned from a second three night stay yesterday and again had a very pleasant experience. This time it was just us and the kids, though we did have a three bedroom again (Building 2 this time, on a high floor - nice view) because it was a last minute trip and evidently the two bedrooms are booked early. No matter, the nightly rate was still more reasonable than just ONE room at any of the hotels (at least any that we would want to stay at) nearby and we saved money just by having a kitchen and washer/dryer. Additionally, our sanity was saved thanks to our kids being able to have a separate room. I noticed a similar cleanliness issue on this trip - trash was found under one of the beds that really should not have been there - makes you wonder what else is missed. Additionally, the bathrooms seem to be showing some wear and tear and could have used a good caulking - but this is typical for the humidity of Florida (we live in the state as well and have similar issues in our bathrooms). We did not take advantage of the pool on either trip, but it looks like a great place to have some fun. We also did not do breakfast - I have seen a lot of people complaining about the lack of variety, but this is a continental breakfast that is included in the room rate, I don't see why that warrants a complaint. It is just as easy to drive to the Publix that is five minutes away and get some healthier options and eat in your own condo, on your own time, without being crowded. Additionally, after reading the negative reviews on the park shuttles, we opted to drive ourselves to the theme parks and felt that this really was the way to go. Bottom line is that this is a very affordable place to stay, generally clean, and extremely convenient to the parks, without making you a slave to the Disney property. We will never stay anywhere else when we go to Disney.",

It really was a home away from home. An initial stop and the 24-hour Super Walmart down the street allowed us to stock the Kitchen for quick meals that saved us a bundle from needing to purchase park food. A 10-min drive to the Magic Kingdom parking lot gave us the ability to leave a cooler in the car, which saved us a bundle on purchasing park food. Only negative comment I can make was that the water pressure in the shower was a little weak. Nothing that I couldn't live with though.",

When I booked my reservation over a month before my travel date, I requested a room in building 2 on a high floor so we could be near the pool and clubhouse. When I arrived, I had been assigned a room in building 7 on the 2nd floor, at the end of the property next to the swamp lake area. Although you are only about 3 minutes away from Disney, this place is very isolated. There was a lake in the back of the building 7 with warning signs about alligators. Although everything was clean and the unit was modern, well-equipped and only minutes away from disney, I would think twice before I would book it again because of the isolated swamp area it is located in.",

I traveled and stayed in 2 condos because I had a family of 12 (3 bedroom and 2 bedroom condo). We had an amazing time. We are Disney fanatics but it is difficult for my mother to walk from our hotel room to the transportantion when staying on Disney property. THis is why I thought to try something new. I can say we were extremely impressed. We walked a short walk to the elevator. The room was beautiful and up to date. It was a 10 minute drive to the parks. The three bedroom suite was so beautiful. I loved having 3 bathrooms. I was able to purchase my park tickets there so another convience!!! THe only thing I did not like was that there wasn't a kiddie pool at the time, especially because we had 3 under 6 but oh well. We are leaving for Disney soon and I have to break it to the family that we are not staying there. They are not going to be happy. Hopefully hubby and I can make a trip and stay at Worldquest this November.",

Our boys (ages 3 and 1) loved the jacuzzi tub the most. The resort was beautiful, the pool was refreshing, and the continental breakfast was a nice way to start each day. We were impressed with how friendly and helpful the front desk staff members were, greeting us each day and taking the time to talk to our boys. The daily housekeeping service was delightful - loved not having to do dishes while we were on vacation! The location was perfect - close and convenient to Disney, as well as area eateries, yet once we drove through the gates, we felt like we left everything behind us. The only downside we could find was the free resort shuttle to Disney, as it offered limited pick up and drop off times that did not coincide with our boys' nap schedule. While we ended up driving to Disney each day, it was a very easy drive and truly wasn't a big problem for us. Driving allowed us to come and go as we pleased, which in the end worked out better. Overall we were very impressed with WorldQuest, and highly recommend it! We will be back!",

        "content": "We booked this resort 2 months in advance for our Disney Vacation and stayed 8 days. I read many of the reviews on trip advisor and some of them made me nervous before the trip. I am happy to say that all my fear was gone 15min after arrival! Absolutletly outstanding!! We stayed in building 1 in a 3 bedroom suite, and let me tell you it has all the room you need. We have stayed in Disney before and this was our first experience outside the park...Completely worth it, especially when you have a larger group so you don't have to be sitting on top of each other like in the disney resort....and for half the cost. The staff was very friendly and happy to help us anytime we needed anything. We opted to decline the daily room service...we were perfectly capable of washing our own towels and keeping it tidy. The pool was beautiful and never overcrowded..great music playing all day long. We stayed on the ground level and you would think there would be some noise...nope! very quiet. Something you definetly want to have is a car. Super Walmart is a couple of miles away and you can stock up on food (there is no restaurant at the resort) and supplies. All the Disney hot spots are literally only 5-10min drives from the resort (the resort does have shuttles but we loved the flexibility of coming and going as we pleased). The complimentary breakfast was nice so you could get up and get a quick bite and be on your way. I would also suggest you stay in building 1,2,or 3 just because they are closest to the pool. I have nothing but good things to say about this resort and while everyone is entitled to their own opinion I found some of the negative and pretentious ones on trip advisor to be unfounded. Bottom line is we loved it and would stay there again!!",

        "content": "From beginning to end, our stay in this hotel was abysmal. I was here for a conference the last week in June, and didn't have a say on where to stay, and was concerned about the reviews I read, but was hoping it was better than others thought. The most negative of the reviews were right on!! The first night, the a/c in the room was non-existent, and the room would not cool off. We called several times, and they told us to radically lower the thermostat, which had no real effect. We then asked to have a fan sent up, which they did after some time. We then asked the next night to have a different room, which was somewhat better, but we luckily kept the fan, or it wouldn't have been usable. The minibar in both rooms was set up so that you couldn't use it to store other cold items without being charged $25.00; even Red Roof Inn have usable mini refrigerators in their rooms! The problems continued - the conference I attended ran out of coffee after 1/2 hour, and the hotel, claiming to take care of this, did nothing until the 2nd day, at which time they still provided inadequate coffee. The hotel staff, other than one young man, were surly and ineffectual. To top things off, in the new room my wife opened the nightstand and found that someone had left a sexual device there! I couldn't make this stuff up! The cleaning staff obviously didn't do their job. We returned the sexual device to the front desk, and didn't receive any formal apology about this. Then after the second night, the comforter that was on the bed was taken, and when the room was made up, the comforter was never returned! 7 phone calls later, on the 4th day we were there, they finally brought a comforter, but it was a full size (the bed was a King), and it was wet! We returned that. For our hassles, the hotel did provide us a free dinner, but the restaurant had horrible service on the terrace, and the young waitstaff acted as though they had never waited on any customer before. I should also mention that the rooms were small. The pool was not handicap accessible, there were two staircases of 10 stairs each leading down to it, in a very inaccessible spot. There were no soda or snack machines anywhere on any floor. They charged 50 cents a minute for computer access in their \"business\" center. Once people found that out, they didn't use it, and it was empty, although the hotel employed a person to sit there and provide service (mostly fielding angry comments about the cost). They charged $ per day for wireless internet access, which is incredibly cheap. On check out, there were hassles with the hotel charging me several Massachusetts taxes, even though I had documentation that because it was a Federally Funded Conference I should not be charged state lodging taxes. Other people at the convention I attended had the same problem. The quality control at this Hyatt is obviously very subpar.",

Right by South Station for easy access to the airport or amtrak and right by the subway as well as in the heart of downtown boston so many things are within walking distance. Our room was very nice and spacious, I don't know how we lucked out, but they put us on the top floor in a corner room. The front desk staff as well as the concierage were all very friendly. We booked a decent deal on this room, would not have wanted to pay full price..but all decent rooms in downtown Boston are overpriced. I can't figure out why hotels don't all offer free wi-fi anymore..just seems like another way to nickel and dime customers especially when this hotel didn't come with any other perks like a free breakfast or even a reasonably priced breakfast ($20 for the buffet!). However, the pool and fitness center did help make up for this, both very nice, but the indoor pool was very cold and no hot tub..but the steam room was nice! But, I would definitely stay here again for the location, quality of the rooms and the staff. Thank you!",

I had asked for a room with two double beds - as I had 3 days of business and then a friend was joining me. I was on the 7th floor - 2 floors above the lobby. At first I was disappointed being on a lower floor - but it worked. I would avoid the 6th floor only because the gym is on that floor and it is open extended hours - which may lead to more noise in the hallway. Speaking of the gym...the workout is getting there - LOL but really it is a great gym with a pool, state of the art gym equipment, steam rooms and really clean. The only misses were the housekeeping staff - they clearly do not read english - which I have no problem with - but they need to speak with their supervisor if they cannot read the note (and tip) I left. I wanted my window left cracked (it was closed) and I had asked for extra Decaf coffee. Also, I had requested turn down service each night - and it was only done 1 night. When I called - they were prompt to send someone quickly - and the turndown staff does a great job of refreshing the room and bathroom. Overall the hotel is in a GREAT location - centrally located - a quick walk from the T (several different T stations - Downtown Crossing, South Station, Chinatown and several others). Very close to Chinatown - attached to a Macys, near many theaters and near the Boston Commons. A couple of quick tips - great and inexpensive lobster at Peach Farm - Chinatown - close to a CVS and the concierge had great restaurant suggestions. I did eat at the Avenue one - the restaurant - the food was very good (lunch) and reasonably priced. I did drink in the bar and wish the red wine choices were more varied. Oh, and one more note: the weekdays the clientele was strickly business - the weekend is a WHOLE different (and louder) crowd - be forewarned",

The inside of the hotel is nice enough, although weirdly laid out. The lobby is on the 3rd floor, and you have to take an elevator from the street level to get to it. This wouldn't be so strange, except for the fact that the elevators to the rooms are on the other side of the lobby. If the elevators were all the same, it would be fine. The rooms were nice, pretty large for downtown, and had great views. I could see the state house clearly from my room. The bed was crazy comfortable, I think it was a featherbed. I just wanted to sleep all day. The only problem with the rooms, and this is a big one, is that the walls are VERY thin. We could hear our neighbors talking, watching tv, even coughing in their room. Which made me wonder what they could hear from our room. Definitely a big minus.",

Good Coffee and Breakfast pastries. Good restaurant for a quiet evening meal. This hotel is much frequented by Airline personnel which is a good sign.",

        "content": "After securing this room on priceline, i was a bit nervous after reading some of the TA reviews! However, we had NO problems at the Hyatt! First of all, there is an elevator that takes you from the street level to the lobby. Then another elevator that takes you up to the rooms. Some people were complaining about this feature, but this is becoming more and more common in larger hotels. It also adds an element of security to your stay. One evening as we were walking from the main elevator to the guest elevator, a stationed Hyatt employee stopped us, and asked to see our room card before boarding the guest elevator. A comforting touch nonetheless. Check in was a breeze. Got the room we requested, and everything was smooth. Julia at the desk was extremely nice and courteous. When we got up to the room (10th floor), the room halls were very cool. Its interesting how they designed it. Blocks of 4 or 5 floors are kind of exposed.. you can look up once you get off the elevator and see the other floors (or down). it has a eurpoean/bavarian forest type of feel in a way! it was kind cool, and unexpected. The room was very clean. The bed was VERY soft. the LCD tv was brand new. the view was even decent. we self parked ourselves... (i believe this was $32 for the single weekend day/night we stayed for). From what i read on the website, i think valet at the hotel, was $42. the parking garage is extremely convenient. at about midnight we ventured to the bar at the hotel.. not a seat remaining. There are tables that are seat yourself to the right of the bar, that are staffed by waiters. we sat and looked at a menu for a late snakc as we just had gotten back from fenway, and decided the late night menu wasnt exactly what we were looking for. Not to mention in the 10 minutes we were there, no one approached us. So we went to Dylan and Max's... about 3-4 minutes down the street. cool, low key bar. Great bar food! The location of the hyatt is interesting. It's suprisingly convenient. The T is really close. The Common is a block away. You are just a block or two from Chinatown section, and you are 'in' the financial district. In my opinion, this isnt really the financial district. We usually stay at Club Quarters. IMO, THAT is the financial district. The Hyatt is more on the fringe i would say. it took about 10-12 minutes to get to fanuiel hall, etc. not too bad. There are stores very close by (dunkin donuts, cvs, tons of retail). I must add that they were SOLD OUT (overbooked actually) the night we stayed... And we had no service issues, nor did we hear anyone else through the walls, floors, ceilings, etc. we had no complaints! The Hyatt's reputation here MAY BE what's hurting it the most. The hyatt is known for its plush accomodations and catering to the higher end. Im thinking this could be it's downfall on the review boards in many instances. We rated the hyatt as very comparable to the other 3.5 to 4 star hotels we have stayed at in Boston and NYC... Clean. Comfy, and conveneint. We really saw no issues!",

        "content": "I had previously lived in Boston and this trip was to meet up with some friends from that time frame. I opted to stay at a hotel as, when booking through Travelocity, the cost of some of the flights to Boston from DC was the same as the flight and a few nights hotel stay as I was only there for 2 nights. That being said, I was already family with the area. One of the first things I noticed and really appreciated was the travel sized toothpaste that was in the bathroom. Sure, this is small detail but most places just seem to give you shampoo, lotion and soap and I had forgotten toothpaste so this was a nice convenience. I was also able to check in a few hours early which was nice since the trip was so short. The bed was nice and comfortable. I could have sleep forever but this did not happen as it seemed every morning nearby rooms were being vacuumed before/right around 9am. The AC rattled a lot and the pipes were noisy when the shower was going in neighboring rooms but other than that, the room was very quiet at night. I had a few drinks one night at the restaurant in the hotel as it was a Sunday night and no other restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel was going to stay open as late. The lobby area is weird but not that inconvenient as its just two elevators to get to your room not too sets of stairs. The area is right in the Downtown Crossing/Theater District area so you will see interesting characters if you return to your hotel late at night but I never felt unsafe and knew before hand that the area is not the worst area that a young female could find herself in. The location actually worked quite well as it won't take you long to get to the airport, shopping, Faneuil Hall, Cambridge and any other popular touristy spot.",

        "content": "We stayed here for 5 nights having booked the hotel as part of a package through British Airways. The price was a major influence in our selection, it was the cheapest central hotel they offered. It was only after that we read more of the reviews and began to get worried. We took a taxi from the airport and the doorman offered to help us with the bags on arrival but we declined. The entrance is strange, the lobby is on the third floor so you need to take a lift (there are 3) from the ground. However, to get to these from the street entrance you need to go down a small flight of stairs which was a pain with the luggage (we wished we had used the bellboy)! Also these doors don't really open properly, they are stuck open at an angle which you can walk through without luggage. If the doorman is there they manage to force them open. Check in was a breeze there was no queue and the agent Rosario, was so helpful making sure that our requests had been fulfilled and offering further help and information. It was then, however, we found out that the pool was shut for renovations which had overrun. This was disappointing for us as we do like to chill in the pool normally. However, Rosario explained they had an agreement with the Langham should we wish to use a pool although as it happened, Boston kept us so occupied we didn't have time. We were on the 19th floor which pleased us and there were four lifts, which although were a bit creaky, were always working and we never had a situation where we had a long wait. The room was very spacious and clean and well maintained. It was, however, a little dated and this is reflected throughout the hotel but not to any extent that disappointed us. We had absolutely no issues with noise at all. Every member of staff we met was always friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even after we had checked out the staff on the front desk were more than happy to give us a key to use the sauna and fitness suite so we could shower before our flight home. We found the location to be ideal. It is on top of Downtown Crossing subway station and Boylston was only a couple of minutes walk too. So many of the attractions were such a short distance anyway that sometimes it was just quicker just to walk. There is also an alternate entrance through Macy's (an alternate set of 3 lifts take you down to there). All in all we had a very good time in Boston and was very pleased with the Hyatt as a choice of hotel.",

The staff were also very helpful and in good spirits, and in the room the view over the common to the Massachussets Sate House was outstanding. But the best thing about the place is the amazing king size bed. The mattress is about 2 foot thick!.

The Boston Ballet (at the Opera House) is right across the street, which was very convienent. The room itself was nice, with very comfortable beds (my friend said they were a little too soft though, but I thought they were great). Their fitness center is also decent, with a selection of cardio equipment (4 treadmills, a few ellipticals, bikes and rowing machines), as well as weights and weight machines. There is a small pool, designed for laps (not very children-friendly if that's what you're looking for). Overall, it was a great experience for the weekend and I would definitely stay again.",

Decor is dated, rooms are quite standard and for some inexplicable reason- I was put in a handicapped room. Furntiure in the room is definitely showing wear and tear and whatever they put on the top of their mattresses, some sort of padding, does not even extend the whole length of the mattress. To boot, I could not get the phone in my room to work properly as I could only manage to work it with the speaker micro on. Additonally, their minibar bar prices are stratospheric. The bar and resutrant in the Hotel Lobby is quite generic with nothing to make it stand out in one's mind. I stayed there because when I think Hyatt- I hink of a pleasant Atrium Area but, if there was one, I did not find it. The exterior of the buuilding is also quite ugly- like a grey concrete fortrress- nothing charming or elegant about it whatsoever. I ewill definitely NOT stay there again.",

When I checked in I was told that the room I booked (two double beds) was not available due to \"damage\" and they had put us in an ovean front room with one King bed and a pull out couch. I as disappointed about the change, but they discounted the upgrade by $10.00 per night, which I appreciated. When we got to our room on the 6th floor it was clean but not up to the standards of a room we would normally stay in. If I had paid full price for the stay I likely would have checked out right then and went someplace else. The shower head was pulled from the wall, corner molding pulled from the wall, faucet was leaking/dripping and the room just felt run-down. You can read the other reviews about the place needing updates, I agree. THe best part of the room was the view of the ocean, and my children really enjoyed that. My older son appreciated the free wi-fi and it worked well for him. The pool area was great and my younger son and I spent most of our time there. They really seem to put alot of effort into making sure he outside of this hotel looks nice. I would suggest that they do all the pool maintenance and cleaning of the area before the pool opens at 8 am. I had to move all of my stuff one morning so that a maintenance guy could hose down/wash the windows in the meeting area. I think he should have done this before the pool opened. I found the front desk/restaurant/bar staff to be very friendly and interesting to talk to. The staff is likely the best part of the hotel, followed by the pool area. In the end, I am glad I got over my initial dislike of the place because it ended up to be a good stay. I hope they continue with the upgrades and improvements.",

        "content": "I bought two Groupons to this hotel, one for four nights and one for three nights, so we stayed for one week total (me, my husband, 10-month old and 6-year old). I read some of the reviews and they were fairly positive so I was surprised at how disappointed I was. First, the hotel is old and it looks and smells moldy; they are renovating so maybe they will take care of the smell. The receptionists at check-in were unpleasant at best. They did not make eye contact and acted like we were a nuisance. We were not told about any features of the hotel - the pool, the restaurant, the bar, amenities, etc. Our room was okay. It had a kitchenette, which was nice, but the fridge leaked so whatever you put in there got filled with water within hours. The freezer was so full of ice it could not be used. There was a microwave, sink and shelving. The room was a decent size and looked fairly clean but the bathroom had mold on the walls and the tile in the shower was literally crumbling. The water coming out of the shower was hot and came out fast - a big plus, but we did not have a tub stopper so we had a heck of a time giving our baby a bath. On a least two occasions, housekeeping did not leave us fresh towels or coffee and when we called the front desk to ask for some they told us they only had one working dryer and we would have to wait until the towels were washed. The patio was small but it faced the ocean which was nice. What wasn't nice were the other tenants that were smoking all around us which made sitting on the patio (and by the pool) unpleasant. The hotel is within walking distance of the boardwalk and ocean shops. The pool was clean but the shallow, three-foot area for kids was very small which made it difficult for my six-year-old to play. There was a one-foot baby pool that was filled with stagnant water - gross. The restaurant on site, Atlantic Jacks, was terrible. We had Groupons to use so we decided to have dinner there the first night. We were the only people there (which should have clued us in that this was not a good place to eat). We ordered and never got our food. We waited 20 minutes, I asked the server where our food was and she laughed. My daughter got bored and crawled under the table and announced that there was gum under the table. We got up and left. We decided to use our Groupons at the bar instead - they didn't have wine and the bartender didn't have what he needed to make most of the drinks they advertised on their sign. He got irritated when I asked him to put cherries in my daughter's Shirley Temple. The bar is connected to the restaurant so if you eat in the restaurant, be prepared to smell smoke. We found out on our sixth day there that they had a breakfast buffet. We spent $30 for, basically, a continental breakfast - cold bacon, cold sausage, toast, danishes covered in fruit flies from the bar, fruit, hard biscuits and hard, cold waffles. The elevators, stairs and parking are a MAJOR safety concern and I will be writing a letter to their corporate office about my observations. The stairwells run on the outside of the hotel and the doors leading to the stairs and to the rooms are unlocked so anyone with ill intentions can hide there. As a woman, I didn't feel safe using the stairs. Plus, they reeked of urine. Secondly, the elevators are very dangerous. The doors close very quickly and the safety feature that lets you wave a hand in front of the door to keep it from closing was not working so my family and I almost had arms and legs crushed by the door, literally. With two kids, bikes, a stroller, a beach tent, etc., it took a minute to get off the elevator and one time the door closed on my arm as I was holding my daughter's hand. She was still in the elevator and I had to put my body in the door of the elevator and push it open. My daughter was screaming and I was completely panicked. The same thing happened to my husband. The other safety concern I had was that we had to park across the street in the overflow lot. I did not feel safe walking there by myself. My husband had to make numerous trips there and he was often stopped by homeless people asking for money. And, it was across the street from Lollipops Gentlemen's Club. Not something I want my six-year-old to see. On our last night there, someone set fire to the dumpster that was right below our room. It could have easily caught the hotel on fire. No one was alerted, the smoke alarms did not go off but the next day, the entire dumpster and surrounding wooden shed it was encased in was burnt to a crisp. Other observations - The pool did not have a bar and the bar did not open until 5; no one was monitoring the pool so there were a few times where unruly kids were carrying on and being obnoxious; we got hassled by some guy as we were entering the building one night (not sure if he was staying there or if he was homeless); dogs are allowed so you may be kept awake by barking; elevators are slow (there are only two); the beach in front of the hotel was great - clean and quiet; the air conditioner fan ran all night which was great for us; the beds and pillows are very firm. We will not be staying at this hotel again or recommending it to others.",

It has a fresh feel and nice clean scent that many other hotels in the area struggle with. We found the amenities to be more than expected with a larger than normal room, a fridge, a microwave and a coffee pot. There was also a cute little restaurant and bar with access to the pool for the days that we decide to relax by the beach. The staff was incredibly friendly and extremely helpful! It's located right on the beach and its only a short walk to mall/movie theaters. I would recommend this hotel above all others that I have stayed at in Daytona.",

We stayed in room 720. The bathroom sink was cracked, the tub leaked, the toliet would continue to run, all the fixtures were rusty, there was unpainted dry wall repair, the decor was worn and mismatched. My husband was perfectly happy with the room but I would have preferred a more up to date room. The ice machine on our floor did not work. The staff was friendly enough but didn't interact with them much during our 5 day stay The room was clean, the view was great, parking was good but is an additional cost. The restaurant was okay, the only reason we patronized it was because we had coupons for it. The location was perfect. The pool area was clean and well maintained. I would only stay here again if I couldn't get a decent rate else where.",

Their restaurant is very nice and the free breakfast was wonderful. The bar is very quaint and friendly. Beach front access was of utmost importance to us and we got it. Although the hotel itself could use some updating and painting in some areas (the main one the balcony) it was nothing obvious and did not affect our stay. Highly recommend this hotel.",

However my idea of a kitchenette and theirs are two different things. Other than a microwave there was no way to cook anything and there was no kitchen table. Which meant we were going to have to spend more than expected on eating out. Although the view was beautiful, the rooms were clean and they were tended to daily. The worst thing about this hotel was the elavator wait times. And don't plan on taking the stairs, they smell like pee. If you weren't in the rooms the rest of the hotel felt muggy. The main area and the restaurant were okay though. The pool was a little over crowded but it was to be expected. Oh and the main lobby during busy pool hours was wet due to all the traffic. The hotel was close to everything which made it an ideal pick, I do think next time I will spend the extra $60-$70 and stay and the Plaza Resort and Spa next door. Atleast they had 3 elavators.",

This trip, we were threatened with possibly not making it to Daytona due to an illness. Last Minute, we decided to go. Although I was terribly ill for the first 5 days of our trip and didn't get to enjoy one minute out in the sun, we still made it out every evening to see the ocean, walk in the sand, and pick up shells. On our last day, Audrey, the owner was gracious enough to let us stay the entire day in our room and on the sundeck until the evening hours. there were hardly any guests left so we had the place practically to ourselves. Audrey even came down and joined us by the pool! We appreciated this time, since I was unable to thoroughly enjoy myself at first. I felt great the last day and my husband and I left feeling very happy. This is what true hospitality is all about! Thank you again Audrey and tropical manor. We will be back again next year!",

The lobby was very nice, with efficient check-in, clean room and bathroom and a simple, but good, breakfast. Maybe because it was a Sunday night and/or low occupany rate, that the only \"hot\" breakfast items were omelets - no sausage, pancakes, etc. However, it was fine and was not a big deal.

To my dismay, I search and searched. Finally I found Embassy Suites-North in Indianapolis. It was a drive to the University, but I didn't mind because the price was somewhat reasonable and the staff was awesome! Lassandra, one of the cooks at the food court, was amazing! She always greeted you with a smile in the morning and her omelets were to die for! Also, Supervisor, Debbie Flemming-Little at the Front desk, was very nice.

The staff was friendly, and accommodating to the fullest extent. As with all Embassy suites, there is a nightly drinks/snack reception, though the snacks consisted of potato chips and doritos one night, with a snack-mix the next. I've seen more lavish spreads at other ES properties, but the bartender was efficient and moved the line quickly. The breakfast was fantastic, nice selection of fruit, pastries, cooked-to-order eggs/omelets as well as french toast. If you did not want to wait, the scrambled eggs were real, not powdered, and cooked with some seasoning. It was a nice touch. The room was typical of most Embassy Suites, the pillows were nice and firm, the bathroom was clean, though a bit small. As with many Hilton properties, the WiFi is not free, not was it particularly fast. (The gentleman checking us in comped it for us!) The atrium, found in many properties, can create a somewhat noisy environment, and it seems like these properties are full frequently. We were tucked away in a corner, so noise was not an issue. The pool area was crowded, and the water was quite chilly, but it was clean and towels were stocked frequently. Being next-door to Costco is a bonus, and you are just down the street from a Trader Joe's and a slew of other restaurants of a variety of gastronomies are nearby. Overall, it was a great stay and we will be back.",

The pool / hot tub areas were crowded but the staff kept it very clean and there was plenty of fresh towels (which is usually a problem at hotels when it's crowded). In the morning the breakfast area was crowded but they had a wonderful large staff to keep up with everything from cleaning the tables to making the food (it was impressive and everyone was smiling - that's rare these days). I can't say anything negative and I definetely recommend it. Plus: I'm a Priceline gal - I use it all the time - I couldn't use it this weekend since all the hotels were full.

This was several garbage bags, obviously left by a housekeeper as they performed other duties. When we left a couple of hours later for dinner, the garbage was still there, although it was finally removed a couple of hours after that. The second issue we had was that the individual shampoo/conditioner bottles had already been opened and used; new ones were not provided until I asked the front desk for some. Other complaints include: the pool was colder than it should have been, there was a stain on the sheet for the pullout sofa, and the hotel was loud (this is a complaint of design though: atrium style hotels usually are louder.) Internet access is noted as free on embassysuites.com for this hotel, but there was a 9.95 charge. The front desk was very pleasant and accommodating, and the lady working the omelet station at breakfast was amazing (fast and efficient, but fun too.

Two downfalls: they do offer a lovely hot buffet breakfast - complete with omelette station. My husband ordered an omelette and could not eat it due to the fake oil/grease they use to 'butter' the pan. Yuck!

It appears they may be just starting to begin some room renovations whch are desperately needed. The heating unit in my room was the loudest I've ever heard- louder than those window-type A/C units and the heater wasn't even that style- it was a central heating unit that rattled and vibrated all night long. The bathroom was tiny, but the rooms were larger than a lot of the other Embassy Suites I've been to which was a bonus. The very worst thing about my stay was the room next to me had their refrigerator die out on them causing a horrible burnt stench for my entire overnight stay and into the next morning. The fitness center is about the size of a walk in closet at best. The only thing this hotel has going for it is a very friendly staff.",

This hotel beat out the 4-star hands down in every category possible - and was a lot better priced. This hotel is very conveniently located downtown - close to everything! We were here for an event at the convention center and it's a very easy walk down the street. The staff (thank you Megan!) was over-the-top helpful. The rooms were nice and clean. The bathroom was good-sized. There are mirrors in the room so that more than one person can get ready at a time in the morning (always a bonus in our family). And best of all, it was quiet! The beds are double, not queen - so on the smaller side. There is a table and two chairs instead of a desk, which is nice for eating takeout or playing games. But the outlets are next to the table for computer usage. There is no refrigerator or microwave in the rooms. They do have a good variety of tv stations and pay movies available. The breakfast is free and is what I would call a continental-plus. There are some hot dishes available as well as the basics - and it's managed by some very sweet ladies who are very attentive. Also, the breakfast room is on the 2nd floor in a very large room with lots of space to move around in. A nice change from the usual squeeze-and-eat of most hotels with free continental breakfasts.",

We were not able to tip him,but called a friend and she gave him a tip which he was reluctant to take-Said he was just doing his job. Looking forward to our trip and stay in 2012.We also love meeting and interacting with fans from other Big Ten Universities.cannot not mention the breakfast and staff who work there. They are so helpful and energetic and hard working. I could say more good things ,but better stop. You get the idea.",

For me this meant an extra two unscheduled nights in Las Vegas. The hotel provides 24 hour shuttle service to the airport and the driver did an excellent job of accomodating my need to go back to the airport several times over two days. The front desk staff was very kind in making sure I had everything I needed and even made recommendations for nearby places the shuttle could drop me for shopping. The breakfast staff and housekeeping were all very attentive and the room clean and comfortable. I can definitely recommend this hotel as a place to stay if you want to be near the airport off the strip.",

Check in was nice the guy was friendly it was after midnight. We did upgrade our room To a strip view in tower. Elevator was quick and clean secure have to use room key which is differant but safe. Short walk to rooms. Clean hallways and nice decor. Room clean great lighting options. Clean beds I checked for critters everything Was clean. Nice decor reminded me of staying at a bed n breakfast. Love seat and coffee table over looking a nice view. Grest place to was people and distant mountains. Bathroom was small sink area nice separate from toilet and bath. Bath area was nice like my old house homey. Shower head felt like rain very relaxing. Cool little window that opens inside tub area. First room I have ever had that had 3 waste baskets love not haveing to walk to find one. Room had no iron but did have a blow dryer. Walk to Freemont was iffy just stay in a group or come back to El Cortez before 11pm. It is a 2 block walk before next casino.",

        "content": "My hubby and I recently returned from a 5 night stay at the El Cortez Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. A birthday present for him. We were going for the car race and thought it would be closer to access a shuttle to the track and I have read positive things on TA about the gaming so thought we would give it a try. I chose a junior cabana suite thinking it would be worth paying a little extra. The decor was modern and funky. Fun to hang out in the room although a little small for a suite. I agree with others on here that the slots appear to be looser than other hotels we have stayed at in recent years and the blackjack pays 3:2 but in our experience quite hard to beat the dealer/house. Most staff in the casino were pleasant but others appeared to be tired and uninterested in their job or the customers in front of them. We found the staff in the Cortez cafe and Flame restaurant were great. It was the hostess in the Flame restaurant that retrieved the information for the shuttle to the race track when we asked at dinner although the bellman and front desk staff had been unable to do so earlier in the day. All staff were very friendly on our visits to both restaurants. The food was exceptional in the Flame restaurant. I would say the lamb chops are a must try as is the scampi and linguini. Meals in the cafe were great and excellent prices and you can use your comp. dollars in both restaurants. There is a walkway from the El Cortez to Freemont that has been refurbished which made it much less scary than I expected. I must admit this was one of my main concerns about staying there was the walk to Freemont at night as it seems a bit out of the way. Looked like a road a less traveled and not so well lit. I am not normally a fussy person or one to complain but this time I felt strongly about the poor housekeeping service and this place being advertised as the only \"boutique hotel\" in the Freemont district. The first morning, inspite of the Do Not Disturb sign posted on the door the maid was trying to enter the door to our room as I was walking out of the bathroom which she apologized for as she looked down at the sign. Thank goodness I was dressed. I assured her we would be leaving soon. Two days later the maid was knocking loudly on the door at 0930 hrs, again I informed her we would soon be leaving soon. I thought Vegas was about staying up late & sleeping in but not here I guess. It appeared the bathroom? or the toilet was being cleaned, we doubt the shower was cleaned, but the water was left running in the toilet on two of the five days. We arrived back about supper time and could only assume it had been running for several hours as it was obvious that the maid arrives fairly early in the morning. So much for water conservation in the desert. Second to our last day we returned that to a poorly made bed, dirty glasses and a dirty coffee cup left on the counter. We wanted to relax and have a drink in our room before heading out and thought a clean glass might be in order, I called down to the front desk who put me through to housekeeping and they said they would send someone up with clean glasses. This person did not arrive so when my husband went out for his cigarette he complained to the woman at the front desk about our disappointment in the poor service and within about 10 minutes the maid was at the door with glasses. By that time he had washed them in the bathroom sink and turned her away in frustration. Too little too late. Boutique hotel maybe but not the service one would expect, Next time I will pay less and return to one of the hotels I have stayed at in the past that have provided much better service for less money. I might return to the El Cortez for dinner and a little slot play but I would not stay there again. There is way too much competition in Vegas these days to not expect decent housekeeping service and clean glasses in your room. By the way very friendly security staff outside the cabana suites building 24/7 which we appreciated as you have to walk outside and cross the street to this building. Overall had a great time in Vegas as usual.",

The location of the Hotel was also above expectation with only a 5 minute walk to Fremont street where also the bus stop is which will take you to the strip or you can easily spend a whole day in that area. And yes, there where also some questionable figures walking around but I never felt unsafe. The security guards from the Hotel and the downtown area are doing a great job, even patrolling the Hotel floors. The Hotel dated back from 1941 and althoug it was renovated, it's still pretty old, so don't expect too much (except clean rooms of course) of it.If you are taking you're date on a romantic trip to Vegas or planning Honeymoon I would recommend staying at another Hotel.",

You must also use your room pass card to access the building. Room had 42\" flat screen, pillow top bed with three king size pillows, mini fridge, coffee maker and deluxe super huge shower, wow. My first ten minutes in the casino I hit on the Double Diamond quarter machine, fity cent bet got me two hundred dollars in quarters. Fun! Their loose slots were mesmerizing. HIt again at the last minute when I had to leave the hotel on their free shuttle to the airport. I was pleasantly surprized to find that shuttle was a comfy Lincoln and not a busted up passenger van. Any problems with my room were remedied ASAP. Employees were cheerful and very accommodating. Service in 24 hour cafe was quick and sweet.

        "content": "Just returned from a two night stay at the El Cortez on a comp I received in the mail. We had a Queen Double in the Tower - Room 614 at the end of a hall. The room was huge! It was nicely appointed and very clean. The bathroom is very small, so if you need a big bathroom, don't stay here. It was quite adequate for the 3 of us tho. We ate a Cafe Cortez for breakfast twice and dinner once. We thought the food was very good, with a very good selection. Service was a bit slow at times, but everyone that worked there was very helpful and friendly. The casino is quite big and spread out. They have the usual table games, with Black Jack at $5 a hand. They have loads of new penny machines and video poker machines in all denominations. Their dollar and quarter slots are very, very old and there is almost NO selection in the quarter range. They really need to get these updated! Many of the older machines were very, very dirty. Maybe there are plans to get new machines and this might be why there is no upkeep on them, I'm not sure? I basically just played video poker, but really would have liked to play some quarter slots. All in all, we had an excellent time! I certainly would stay there again and look forward to doing so on my next trip.",

When I got to my room, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the room was big and liked the layout. I had a one bed tower room that had a great view of the Strip and mountains in the distance. The only thing I could see someone having a problem with is the height of the shower. I'm short, so it was OK, but a tall person might find it annoying. Everyone I met during my stay was friendly and the casino had a \"homey\" feel unlike the huge Strip casinos. I never felt that it was unsafe in the area outside of the casino. For anyone who really likes all the glitz of the Strip, this may not be the place for you. It's not \"glitzy\" at all. I would stay there again.",

First, check- in was quick, and our Tower Strip-View room was very cool inside with outdoor temps hovering over 110... The classic hardwood furnishings and decor pleased my most particular friend. The beds were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was of adequate size, regardless what others have posted here...We're average sized guys and none of us felt confined in there. Plenty of hot water for our 3 long showers, and the drain drained properly too... The soaps, shampoos and etc were of fine quality, and supplied daily with the thick towels provided. What more could we ask for? The room was quite soundproof, and we didn't hear any noise from other guests at any time during our stay, and we slept at all sorts of hours too. The housekeepers did an excellent job of cleaning daily, so a hefty tip was in order! The casino is great for us low-rollers, and we were able to play for quite a long time on our budgets. Cocktail service was excellent too, no matter where in the casino we were. That $1 tip brings that server back often! Oh, the food was great, especially with our $5 'Fun Book' coupons. A large Prime Rib dinner with all the etc in Kitty's for $6 was primo! The breakfast buffet will have you full all day too. All the El Cortez servers were top-drawer and courteous... I now have a couple more friends to join me for a gamblin' vacation anytime for little $$$, and we highly recommend it too!",

        "content": "We booked this hotel via travelworm.com for $60/nt for two nights on Dec 28-29. We got a two-queen-bed Tower Room above the garage. The room is big, the beds and sheets are clean, but the bathroom is small. It's a smoking room, but we felt comfortable and didn't sense any bad smell (we're not smoking persons). It's located in LV downtown, two blocks from Fremont Experience, and about 5-10 minute drive to the strip. They also have free parking lots, but no free internet. So far, everything is good as we spent most the times out of town and just needed a place to sleep. However, the lobby/casino area is very stinky with smoke. It's so stinky that we didn't even care to use their free $20 gambling coupon as we had to run into the lift every time we had to pass this area. Fortunately, we rent a car and could access the lift from parking lot. Overall, it's good value hotel for budget-minded travelers. If you need an up-scale hotel, it may not suit you.",

        "content": "Plaza vs El Cortez? After seeing the reviews and the recommendations.......we chose the El. 2/8-2/12 3pm check in time, but earlier check in was no problem. We had a great room (tower) with double queen beds on the 12th floor (Rm 1207) facing the strip. With our 2-4-1 coupon found in the American Casino Guide (a must to buy, but check the book when you receive it in case there are missing coupon pages if you buy thru Amazon or E-bay) and our meager slot play return, we payed $277.20 for 5 nights for a fantastic stay. Soda and ice machines on each floor. Don't put their Vegas tap water in a water bottle to save $ from buying high cost water on Fremont St or the strip. Tap water tastes horrid but suitable to brush your teeth with. Front desk clerks were sooo nice and very helpfull. They had lost our information on our stay, so thankfully I had brought a copy of our confirmation that was done thru their web site. I recommend that everyone print it out and bring it. We asked for a fridge, which was rolled in on a nice size cart that we were able to set up our own one cup coffee maker on top of. My husband loved that . Also the love seat with coffee table which he loved relaxing on after a long day of walking. The t.v was a bigger than what we saw in the other reviewers pictures and worked great with lots of channels. Again, nice to relax to for the short time spent in the room. Plenty of super hot water, great water pressure (even during peak usage times) and tub drained quickly. No water backed up. The bathroom and large window in the room opened up (4 inches) for ventilation. The beds were soooo comfy & very clean. The curtains darkened the room so we never knew what time it was in the a.m. Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning when we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. Great!! We were there 5 nights (including weekend) and thought we had the whole floor to ourselves because we only ran across two people in the hall on our last night. Very quiet rooms. The rooms (rugs, furniture, walls etc) were spotless and believe me, I checked under the mattress for the creepy-crawley things that were found, with pictures to prove it from other reviewers, in nice places like the Bellagio (mice) and the Luxor (bed bugs). Nothing to report!!! yea!!! In case you forget them, they provide shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash & hand soap. I tipped Housekeeping a couple of dollars each day, which I left on the bed with a note so they would know it was for them, and left them more on our last day. Please show them your appreciation. I also left them some 2-4-1 coupons that I had leftover from other downtown buffets which I'm sure they could use because they weren't just for players with cards. We won't be back for another year so no use to us. Feeling safe in the casino and area? Yes....for sure. They had security walking around and I played slots by myself until 3am while my husband retired back to the room to sleep. They also had security on the corner of Fremont & 6th Ave to watch the walkers coming back from the FSE. This is also the corner that we had to wait for our Grayline shuttle back to the airport, so we felt very safe. He actually seemed to know the regulars that were coming and going and everyone was very respectfull. We did Grayline ($14 pp) round trip because we didn't know at the time of our flight booking that the El also provides shuttles. If you use the El's shuttle, please make your rez with them as they request? They're not mind readers and need to know ahead of time of your needs to get you there in plenty of time to get thru the airports security. There's a \"lot\" of constuction going on in that area because the El is fixing up their front door entrance. The road is being torn up, I'm assuming because of the new Streamline condo's needs for bigger water/sewer lines. This shouldn't stop you for going to the El as the strip is also always seeing a lot of construction and it's just a fact of life in Vegas. The gift shop is open 24 hrs with munchies to buy to enjoy before bed. After doing that at 3am every morning, the security at the elevator got to know that I was done for the night and wished me a pleasant beddy-bye and never said \"don't let the bed-bugs-bite\" LOL. Sorry to say I can't comment on the food other than the breakfast buffet. You'll have to find those reviews with the others. The breakfast buffet is o.k. How can they mess up scrambled eggs, sausage, cinnamon rolls and coffee anyway. Our needs are just basic for the a.m........ \"don't stop the coffee refills!!!\" Plenty of different denominations on the slot machines with a lot of the old favorites and new ones. Yes.....even the penny \"Cashman\". They were by far, looser and more available (less people) than the strip but not as loose as the \"Fremont Casino\". One bonus round on a Fremont Cashman gave me $252. Sorry, my secret as to which one. LOL!! More hits on other machines but I won't go into them as this is a review about the El. Sorry again that I can't comment on the card tables, but other reviewers have written about them. Low bets etc. The Duece ($5 for a 24 hr pass and also good on all CAT buses if going to casinos off the strip...Rio etc) is a short one block walk from the El and FSE is a quick 2 block walk. If you ride the Duece and going to the Strip, enjoy the ride from the upper level. If you're 5'7\" or taller, duck your head up there because that's how low the ceiling is. We enjoyd the sick humor of watching people, especially the men, smack their heads when they reached the top of the stairs before they realized the ceiling height.....even though there's a sign stating it. Very funny! LOL I hope I covered everything that you might need to know about the El. I tried to talk about the things \"I\" might want to ask if I was going to try a new place and hopefully covered it all. Go to the El, enjoy its comfort & super clean rooms, feel secure and save your $ for all of the other crazy things to see and do while in Vegas. Rocky's Hun",

This was only the beginning, the air conditioning sucked, not to mention the toilet. We saw people getting arrested and were woken up by a fighting couple in the next room. They also put a hold on my credit card even though I paid cash for the room. The staff was rude, when we saw a bell boy and we were tiredly carryng our luggage he did not even offer to take it.

        "content": "When I told the cab driver where I was staying, he did a double take. That should have been my warning but since I had no where else to go, I was stuck. To say this place is tired is an understatement. Upon entering, it took me about 10 minutes to locate the 'front desk'...which is little more than a recessed kiosk. I got to the elevator and into my room. The room was cavernous...very large and covered in old stained pink carpeting. The doors rattled and the lock didn't seem secure. At night, I wedged a chair against the door for added protection. This was a huge room but the sparse furniture in the room was all set around the walls and made the room uncomfortably large. The bed was set against one wall and the small tv was set all the way across the room on an old dresser. It was so far away, the remote didn't work unless I got out of bed and walked up a few feet. The casino itself is old...old...old. Carpeting is old, stained and tired. Much like the elephant's graveyard, I truly believe this is where gamblers to go die. I played some texas hold 'em there and true to some of the 'press' the owner sat down and played with us. He was a nice enough guy but has some serious health problems and drank himself into a stupor while playing. The drink lady obviously knew him well and had been there for years. She was visibly concerned about his health and questioned his drinking...which just aggrevated the owner. It was not a pleasant scene and was actually depressing. The owner eventually staggered away. While at the table, I struck up a conversation with the guy next to me. We were having a pleasant conversation and this particular dealer ragged on us incessantly about 'table talking'. I like social games and that's half the fun but this guy ragged us to the point that we quit tipping him. The other guy eventually told the dealer to go ---- himself and left and I followed suit. The casino is a block off from the Fremont Street Experience and block you have to cross is a concern. The cab driver warned me not to be out at night in that area. He said there were a lot of crack heads and they were known to mug people. I ended up playing downtown a lot but made my way back before dark each evening. Careful Kitty's is ok. It's an old diner. Food was alright and the service was friendly. There were lots of old tired-looking people hanging around who appeared to have health related problems. I'm truly sorry for these people but I was there to have fun and it was just depressing. I went back there once with my girlfriend to show her the place. She couldn't believe I actually stayed there. She played some slots and then said that the place 'creeped' her out and she wanted to leave NOW... I'll stay downtown anytime and actually prefer it to the strip but I'll never make this mistake again. The room was cheap but I paid a much higher price by sacrificing my enjoyment. I've been to Vegas many times and this was, by far, the worse experience I've ever had.",

But location in Amsterdam is a relative thing, as we discovered after renting bikes; you can easily move around the city with them: fast, cheap, green and fun way to discover the city. Unforunatley, I can't say anything positive other then that about this hostel-like hotel. The bathroom door was broken, the floor looked really dirty and used, as the rest of place.

        "content": "When choosing a hotel you have to ask yourself what is it I am looking for. Vegas especially offers a very wide array of choices, so you really need to ask that all important question. Do you want glitz and glamor, pretty people and high end entertainment, spas and shopping? If so then the strip is the place to be. If I were treating myself and my wife to a fun vacation trip probably that's where we would head. Or if we were looking for just a basic, more budget minded, gamble a little play a little trip, then downtown might be our choice. This trip was a business trip, and downtown was simply more convenient, to say nothing of less costly. This was my first stay at the Fremont and it fit the bill very nicely, thank you. The room while not large was more than adequate. It was clean, as has been mentioned in some other reviews, tastefully redecorated recently. It was a nonsmoking room/floor and I didn't detect any smoke odor in the room although a little from the main floor does make it's way into the hall around the elevator. The bed, pillows and bedding were comfortable. The bath room was small, while I had no problems, it is a one person at a time proposition. Loved the water pressure, huge plus for me. Restauranting downtown offers a pretty wide choice, I opt mostly for sandwiches etc when not entertaining. People-watching under the canopy of the Fremont Experience is almost as good as any number of the shows one can see on the strip. But as I have said this was first and foremost a business trip. The staff was extremely friendly did their job well. Housekeeping missed servicing my in-room coffee, front desk handled it in a timely fashion. Check out was a little slow with only one person on station. Al in all have to give it a thumbs up. Not fancy, but the equal of any mid-range Motel chain. I booked as a Flight/Hotel package and was very pleased with the great value for the money.",

        "content": "As mentioned in the title, I rated this hotel a \"4\" for gambling and not necessarily for the rooms, although the rooms are bit smaller than what you'd get up on the strip, the excellent gambling makes up for it all. We just recently got back from an 11/11/11 trip and definitely enjoyed bringing back home all the money we went up with, plus more. We enjoyed playing every single day (6 days of fun) around the clock at the Fremont and other downtown vicinity hotels. Rooms have been updated as far as the decor goes, can't change the size of the room, but it's still kept clean, no flat screen tv, but that's ok, we're not here to stare at walls 24/7 or the TV...but strictly to play, enjoy and have a lot of fun, which we always get when staying at the Fremont. Table games, slot machines, poker machines, you name it, they got it and a lot of guests to boot, which makes this one of the best old times downtown \"happening\" hotels on the Fremont street experience. Now, don't go there expecting a 4 or 5 diamond rated room, because like I mentioned earlier, its \"old time\" Vegas, and not your spa & resort style uptown atmosphere, but the years of \"old gone by,\" where the real gamblers of past preferred staying and still do. As far as food goes, we skipped the buffet this time because most of our family vacationing there were staying at either the Main Street Station or the California (all Boyd hotels), so most meals were usually at the Main Street station hotel & casino. We did pick up some last minute in-between and after gambling eats at the open cafe where you can find a variety of fast food such as chinese, American, etc. and I can't forget to mention that huge bowl of delicious oxtail soup (with rice), you'll just have to try this one out. Also, be sure to try Tony Roma's restaurant, known to make some excellent ribs and other goodies, but, be sure to make reservations in advance. The overall happy atmosphere at this hotel is due not only to the type of guests that patronize this place, but also due to a lot of friendly, courteous and professional employees who'll help to make your stay comfortable, enjoyable and memorable. As far as parking goes, I normally only do valet in Vegas, hey, just let them park your car (it's much safer), and what's a two or three dollar tip when you'll be dropping even more into that slot machine or on that favorite table game of yours, for me, I call it convenience by getting right off at the the front door. Fremont is one of the best located downtown hotels there is with a 1 minute walk (I'm not kidding either) to Binions, Golden Nugget and the Four Queens casino & hotel. Fremont is a \"Boyds\" casino, & one can venture to it's sister properties, the Main Street Station or the California hotel & casino via a 4 - 5 min. walk down the street. Don't forget to sign up for your Bconnected players card which can also be used at all \"Boyds\" and \"Coast\" properties, and used to get \"comp\" rooms, discounts off buffets when you show your card, and at some of the sun dry shops too. Fremont is a good value for your money (it's not the Venetian) but you'll have loads of fun staying at this iconic oldie of an oldie hotel. Enjoy and happy gambling!",

It also has a very good location & you can easily avoid the noise of Pigalle or Montmartre's high prices, but they're within stumble distance if you decide to explore.

The downside to our room was that we had a view of the air conditioner unit, but we couldn't really complain since we only paid $30 CAD a night (which included friday night!). We didn't have the chance to eat at the fremont as they close their buffet for several weeks in december (dec 12ish - jan). The casino is a little bit smokier than others, but was chock full of people at all hours (mostly hawaiians). The front desk staff were very friendly. I would recommend renting a car and staying here, its a better value than strip hotels. Also, try the main street station buffett, its really fantastic (especially for the price!! $7.77 for lunch!).",

Like old Vegas hotel/casinos the rooms at the Fremont were designed as a place to crash between gambling binges and not a room to hang out or conduct business. The TV had CNN (plus 9 other channels) and pay per view movies and I thought it was sufficient. This is the first time I stayed Downtown and I think Im coming back.

Comfortable bed and nice linens. We were asked what part of the hotel we would like. I asked for a room away from the Fremont exxperience where it would be quiet. That was not a problem. Never heard any noise. The room attendent was very good. We have no problem with the Fremont and would stay there again. Love downtown. It is very fun and cozy. The strip is fun for us to visit, but not to swtay there.",

        "content": "If your trip to Vegas is more about business than sin-city style debauchery, you might like the straight forward approach of this small hotel. Well it's small for Vegas anyway. This means you don't have to walk through a smoky casino and you can make it from the entry to your room in under 2 minutes. The gym was open 24 hrs and was well appointed. Bed very comfortable with high quality linens. The room in general was spacious and well appointed. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and they started to recognize me by the second day. If you are after a real las Vegas strip experience with a lot of exotic features, uber luxury, glitz and glamour, this is not it. I was in Vegas for an event at the convention center (a 2 minute walk away) and was exhausted at the end of each day. I happily retreated to this quiet space. The restaurant was, again, not exotic but very good with more than decent selections and reasonably priced. When I had a bit more time to explore, Encore, Wynn and fashion show mall were easy walking distance. I found it to be a relief not to have to stay in a busy, noisy, huge hotel while working. Would definitely go again.",

We enjoyed coming back at night to a quiet environment and being able to get away from the smoke filled casinos.

Were it not for him, I I would've rated this place lower. The room was clean, but old and drab, as was the bathroom. It might've been a bit depressing, but I wasn't in the room much so it was okay. More importantly, the sheets were clean and it good condition, as were the towels. The bed and pillows were comfortable. I did experience a few irritations while I was there. The alarm clock in the room was not working. The friendly gentleman at the front desk said someone would be by shortly with a replacement. Also, the chain in the toilet broke, so it wouldn't flush. Luckily one of us is very handy and fixed it. We waited about 30 minutes for the clock, but then had to get something to eat. The clock never arrived, but in the end it wasn't needed because the maid was vacuuming the hallway at 7:30am Saturday morning! Ridiculous. Koval Lane is very close to the strip, but it has a lot of VERY seedy looking apartments and derelict buildings which made me feel a little uneasy as we approached the motel. Our cards wouldn't unlock the door to the hotel which was closest to the casino and restaurant, so we had to walk all the way around it was pretty cold, so that was annoying. Ellis Island is a great restaurant-- you can tell by the line-ups and people's willingness to wait up to an hour for food. The portion size, quality and price are one of the best in Las Vegas. Skip Super 8, but have a meal at Ellis Island.",

        "content": "We stayed at this hotel twice during our USA vacation, on the day of our arrival to the USA and again on the night before our departure. We chose it because it had an airport courtesy shuttle, was within walking distance of the Strip and had a restaurant next door. We weren’t disappointed with our choice although for some people it could be too far to conveniently walk to the Strip. The rooms were well maintained, clean and large and the air conditioning was effective without being too noisy at night. On our second visit we did have a similar problem to another reviewer in that our room key malfunctioned twice and we had to call for the maintenance man to unlock the door. Whilst the rooms were clean the corridors we poorly maintained and could do with new carpets and some fresh paint and brighter lighting. The reception staff were efficient but not as friendly as many other USA reception staff. Remember, this is a budget hotel and therefore don’t expect the luxury of the larger hotels on the Strip. If you just need a room for a night then it’s OK but if you are looking for several nights luxury accommodation in Las Vegas then I’d choose elsewhere. The Ellis Island restaurant/casino next door did a good evening meal and breakfast although be prepared to wait 40-45 mins (at 7.30pm) for an evening meal. The night we went there it was packed but they had an efficient system for turning the tables around and getting people seated. There is also a 7-11 store nearby which makes it easy to stock up with provisions.",

Why are the guest rooms black and white (with some pink, thank God) looking like the Viceroy Hotels? The dining room is way too small, and the outdoor patio is way too big with wasted space. The service and food are excellent. But how sad that they blew the decor everywhere.",

Arrive at the discrete entrance, an intelligent and interested employee sorts your car and your luggage whilst escorting you across the bridge to check in. The rooms are mainly in single level villas, spread along various winding pathways in beautiful and immaculate gardens - so there's noise neither from above nor nearby, and it never feels crowded as you make you way through the hotel. Every detail is carefully attended to - the valet parking noticed I opened the roof on my car, so afterwards always delivered it to me with the roof ready down, the rubbish cleared out, fresh bottles of chilled water in the cup holders. The pool attendant placed a towel on the ladder the moment I dived in - and had everything from fruit to sun lotion and magazines to hand in case you wanted it. The concierges really made the place. Tickets for the Getty Villa, arrangements for the best studio tour you can get, advice on good routes to destinations for seeing interesting stuff along the way, all this and much more. The best was to describe a type of skateboard I wanted to take back as a gift, but didn't know the name of - and come back to my room to find one sitting on the desk. Rooms are excellently specced out and every one of the staff was of the highest calibre - from the gardener I asked about some work they were doing to the parking staff, the bar waiters - and of course those concierges.",

The terrace restaurant has a very European feel with plenty of movie moguls and hedge fund-types in abundance. The food is always good and the wine list filled with great vintages.

It's in the centre of town so all the restaurants and shops are within easy walking distance, but more to the point the staff at the Pioneer Inn are so friendly and helpful - you tell me in what other hotel the receptionist (the lovely Katherine) would offer to lend you her library card because you had run out of books to read?? And really that sets the tone for all of the staff, nothing is too much trouble and they are all only too ready and willing to go that extra mile to make your stay wonderful. Staying on the rooms on Front Street won't be right for you if you are 'light sleepers' because the action goes on into the early morning but it suits us because we can sleep through anything and one of the highlights for us is sitting on the balcony and 'people watching' with a drink in hand late in the evening - or sometimes with a coffee early morning (and this time we had a 'Grandstand View' of the Maui Marathon which went right down Front Street) I hope we get back to Maui sometime because we love the island and if we do it will definitely be another stay at the Pioneer Inn. Oh and a special mention for Alex the African Grey Parrott in the bar for making everyone laugh with his repertoire!!",

        "content": "I have been to Maui 4 times now and I've stayed at the Westin Ka'anapali, the Embassy Suites (back when it was a hotel), and the Grand Wailea previously. Since I was going to Maui on my latest trip alone I decided to be a bit more economical and stayed at the Pioneer Inn. I'd noticed it on previous visits and a co-worker who had stayed here recommended it. The rates are comparatively very good and the location is great since I'm a big fan of Lahaina. I stayed here for 5 nights in Sept. '06 when I was on Maui for the marathon weekend races. The race starts were just a short drive up the coast...maybe 10 mins. tops which wasn't a problem at all. Not having a beach right outside my door wasn't a problem either in my case especially since I love putting the windows down on my rental car and turning up some local tunes on the radio and enjoying the drive. I went to several different spectacular beaches all up and down the coast which I think is the best way to see Maui anyway. I'd do this even if I were at one of the higher end resorts. While at the Pioneer Inn I really enjoyed getting up for sunrise in the mornings and sitting on the seawall which was right outside my door and watching Lanai light up as the sun hit it. I also enjoyed watching the local kids surfing right in front of the hotel before they went off to school in the mornings and again in the evenings. I liked the idea that the locals seemed to congregate at a small park right outside the hotel by the seawall. This spot is one of the most relaxing I have ever experienced. I enjoyed walking the streets of Lahaina in the evenings also and meeting some of the local characters...and they have their share...and you will meet them unless you make an effort not to. All of this was right there surrounding the hotel, so I loved it. As for the hotel itself, being a history fan, I enjoyed the character of the place and the old feel of it. My room was fairly large and clean if not overly plush. It's not the Westin or the Grand Wailea, but it is perfectly functional and I didn't spend much time there anyway other than to sleep. The balcony was a bit public, but that was charming to me. My room overlooked the banyan tree and I actually enjoyed hearing the birds when I sat outside. I wasn't bothered by them at all when the door was closed and I was sleeping. The a/c in my room was fine and not loud at all as a previous reviewer noted. I liked the interior window shutters that actually worked rather than being for decoration. They do help keep out the noise and light also. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. I had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant and it was very good. I recommend it. Sitting out on the lanai watching the town come alive in the morning was very nice. Parking was a couple of blocks away which you may want to know ahead of time, but it was free and walking through the streets of Lahaina is fun anyway. Had a great visit and plan to return this September. I'd recommend it to anyone not determined to stay at a luxurious resort on a beach. Those places are great too, but for a relaxed low key vacation this place is it.",

        "content": "The oldest hotel in town, the Pioneer Inn, is a local landmark. Itâ€™s smack in the middle of Lahaina. I stayed there with my wife and 3 boys (ages 11, 9, and 5). Itâ€™s not a place I would want to spend a week at, but for a night or two it has a great location while capturing the feel of Lahaina and its kooky, touristy fun. The Pioneer Inn was built in 1901 and was the only hotel in western Maui until 1964. Itâ€™s now under the Best Western banner. There is a plaque at the registration desk citing them as one of the top Best Westerns in the country. Iâ€™m not surprisedâ€¦it was definitely the best Best Western I have ever stayed at. They had a set of rules posted by the desk from when the hotel first opened. Some of them are pretty funny such as â€œIf you burn or wet you bed, you going outâ€� and â€œYou are not allow in the down stears in the seating room or in the dinering room or in the kitchen when you are drunk.â€�. Fortunately, the boys remained sober and enjoyed climbing the banyan tree next door for nearly an hour. We had a great lunch at Aloha Mixed Plate and the boys satisfied their pizza jones at B.J.â€™s that night. You will not lack for dining choices in Lahaina. Our room was a â€œsuiteâ€�, although there was no separate sitting room. It was very spacious, however. We had a king bed and a queen pull-down Murphy bed. The hotel also has pretty decent and FREE wireless high-speed Internet access. There was a small lanai that overlooks an inner courtyard. You have no privacy on the lanaiâ€”itâ€™s more a motel-like internal open hallway with the lanais separated by open wooden fences. Our room overlooking the garden was very peaceful, however. A number of rooms overlook the main drag, Front Street. I would imagine they could be pretty noisy and/or excellent vantage points for first-class people watching, depending on your mood. The room was very clean and everything was in working order. Reception staff was gracious and friendly. All-in-all, this is no fancy resort, but is a very good value. I would definitely stay again. The morning we checked out we had excellent, plate-covering macadamia nut pancakes in the hotelâ€™s restaurant. A nice cap to a nice stay. When youâ€™re in Lahaina you look at the pretty green clapboard siding of the Pioneer Inn with its white trim and you say to yourself, â€œgee, I wish I could stay in a place like thatâ€�. Well, you can.",

Of course, we had heard that Grand Wailea is the place to stay which is why we booked this hotel, but we did not know all of the little things this hotel had to offer that will keep us coming back here over any other hotel on the island. The grounds are truly beautiful! I was apprehensive about staying at such a large hotel at first, but it is so easy to navigate around the property and all of the different pools and slides all connect to one another. The grotto bar (in the water) is our favorite!The beach is not only beautiful on this side of the island but literally a few steps away from the pool, so it is super convient to go back and forth. They have this program at the hotel where we rented unlimited access to kayaks, paddle boarding, snorkeling gear, etc. for four days and it was totally worth the money; especially compared to the cost to purchase these types of activities outside the hotel. We also took advantage of the beautiful spa and fitness center which I only have good things to say. All of the staff were very professional and friendly from the bellmen to the maid service. After our bed was turned down at night, they would turn on the radio so you had music playing when you came in. We even didn't mind the mandatory daily valet parking, bc we could just call for our car when we knew we were leaving and it would be at the front when you arrive along with any directions you need. When we compared that to the time it would take to get to your car if you self parked, we felt like it was worth it. We got breakfast buffet included when we booked our package which was really useful, so you should check into the current promotion when you are booking your reservation. Next time we return, we will be excited to try the new restuaurant with chef, Alan Wong. I think it is opening in April and sounds great. Again, wonderful experience! We had originally looked into Four Seasons and now seeing everything Grand Wailea has to offer, we can't imagine going anywhere else.",

        "content": "Beautiful resort, clearly. Very much enjoyed the focus on artwork. Service and staff effort was first rate - except for my concierge experience I'll note later. Until the new restaurant opens, the resort only has 2 full service restaurants and both are oriented for ocean views. Its impossible to get a reservation for either resort restaurant from open to 8pm every day without advanced reservations as they are fully booked with sunset viewers. Both restaurants are good and my dinner at Humuhumu was a highlight of the trip. I'll note that this was my first trip to Maui - a place that was recommended by friends as THE island to experience a slower pace and quiet relaxation. My rooms lanai was great. I watched the sunset from there every night and I loved it. But the resort itself is busy - with alot of families with children, business conferences, etc. I saw the amenities before I arrived so I cant say this was unknown but I hoped for more in the way of adult quiet. My experience with the concierge service was much poorer than the Waldorf Astoria name would imply. I visited twice. Once inquiring how to order and ship fruit and flowers to the mainland. The other was to book a restaurant reservation for my birthday - which at that point I saw as a necessity as, previously noted, restaurant reservations in the Wailea area are tough. For the fruit and flowers inquiry I was handed a brochure that I could use to order from a local company. As much as I tried, I was looking for the concierge to understand I wanted them to arrange the order to my home address. Instead I walked away with a brochure. For my birthday dinner, since the Grand Wailea concierge doesnt appear to have access to preferred tables at their own resort - I was sent offsite to the Four Seasons. My dinner at Duo was very good - and that time at the Four Seasons resort next door showed me that it was likely the place I would visit next as it was more adult oriented and was more responsive to service requests. The Duo staff presented me with a birthday desert. The Grand Wailea, after telling the concierge I was there for my birthday, didnt present me with any greeting at all. I wasnt in Maui expecting birthday freebies but something, anything would have been nice. As many have posted, the additional costs ie parking and resort fees seem unnecessary. Include it in the room rate and be done with it. I'm a Hilton Diamond member and the lack of Diamond amenities was disappointing. The rooms are showing signs of wear, ie dented walls, chipped bathroom tiles - but these are small details. The room itself was very fine. But again, not Waldorf Astoria level given what I associate that name with.",

        "content": "We started this debacle by being deceived about how many wristbands we could receive when we checked in. Then, when we complained about this, the manager told us there was nothing he could do and whoever told us that we could have more wristbands was wrong. Then, we were supposed to have the oceanview room and when we got to our room, all we could see were palm trees. The bellman told us to just move the palm trees in our head. Then, when we are in the room, our bathtub is disgusting and we complained to the housekeeping staff and nothing was done. My wife had to clean the bathtub, ON OUR HONEYMOON!!!! The shower had mold in it, the air vents were black with filth, and there was dirt on the walls itself. I know we paid the local rate but that doesn't give anyone the right to do such a poor job. When we complained to the manager, Hilme, he implied that since we shouldn't expect much since we were getting the local rate. Just because I was a savvy shopper and knew people on the island is no reason for their standards to be lax. Then, we found that the valet parking (which is mandatory) is pretty ridiculous considering they are charging 30 dollars for parking. Then, I found out that 30 dollars is not total for your stay but PER DAY, which is not mentioned anywhere, which is fraud by the way. We complained and the valet manager reversed the charges after apologizing for the \"miscommunication \". When we checked out, we complained about the many problems and the manager, Hilme again, told us that \"A hundred off is more than generous considering you got the local rate.\" Now, not only is that being prejudiced against the local Hawaiian people, that is also showing bias against their guests for being savvy shoppers. That's not even remotely approaching the level of class that we were expecting from the hotel for something that was not our mistake. I expected our stay to be comped and apologies abounding. Instead, I got apathy and rudeness. Now, I work for the Bellagio in Las Vegas and when I booked our stay, they told me that the Grand Wailea was the Bellagio of Maui. Unfortunately, from what we saw, the cleanliness and professionalism of the hotel is comparable to a low-class Days Inn. I am extremely disappointed in the level of service and customer care that we received and I will be relating that information to every guest at the Bellagio who asks for the best place to stay in Maui. I will now be referring people to the Kea Lani from now on. That \"should be more than generous\", as the manager put it. They should have cleaned the room thoroughly. They should not have defrauded and deceived people about the price of parking and if they were gonna charge for parking, they should have offered the option of self parking. It is a Waldorf property, and I expected impeccable cleanliness, style, and charm. Instead, I got attitude, mold, dirt, and a poor attitude. I expect someone to contact me immediately regarding this problem. I expected more from a 4 diamond property.",

For what was supposed to be a relaxing afternoon with my husband at the spa, due to the poor customer service we experienced, it soured everything and I wish we had never gone. In addition, there were foreign gardeners right outside my massage room, chattering away, so it made for a very un-relaxing experience. Also, my massage therapist was just average- I thought their standards would be higher. When we complained to the spa manager on duty afterwards, she was very indifferent, like she didn't care. She gave us coupons to use their hydrotherapy again (which I believe is free to use with any service), which we will not use. We will not waste our valuable vacation time there again. Go somewhere else where the staff actually care.",

Everyday the parents of kids go down to the pool and save all the chairs with towels. They are gone by 8am-ish. If you try to use one you will be quickly told that little Jimmy is on his way! They claim to have an adult pool but no one regulates this - not even the adult hot tub. There were also never any towels at the pool after the peek hours of the day (after 4pm). You can call housekeeping but no one will come. Not to harp on the kids, but I tried to make a spa appointment and was told that I could not be booked anytime during my four day stay because they had several \"little girl\" birthday partys to accommodate. At the prices of the spa I couldn't believe it! We were there for a conference my husband attended so we only paid a small portion of the bill but if I were coming out of pocket $600+ a night I would have been highly upset!",

All of the restaurants at the hotel were wonderful. The exciting swimming areas are full of caves, hot tubs, and slides and are fun for the whole family or a couple on a retreat.

There are fish ponds and many beautiful photo locations. It was Christmas,so the decorations all over the resort were fantastic! We were greeted at the luau with such charm and friendly smiles,escorted to our table for 9 and shown where to get drinks while waiting for the show to start. They even had lawn bowling and tattoos for the kids,which ours thoroughly enjoyed. The luau served drinks throughout and offered specialties such as pina coladas and mai tais (both alcoholic and non for the kiddies) and then they had the uncovering ceremony at the Emu pit. Finally the show started and the buffet was served. My husband and I had been to a luau before and the food here just didn't stand up at all. It was very disappointing,considering the splendor of the resort and show. I would recommend this only if you were already staying at the hotel,otherwise,spend a few more dollars and go to the Old Lahaina Luau.",

The room service for breakfast on the lanai was good. I liked the place. Maui, however, is too touristic for me. Maui is great for golf and seclusion at a resort.

I should have known better when I found out that the Grand Wailea is in bankruptcy. The optimistic side of me thought this would cause the staff to be more appreciative of their guests, but boy was I wrong. It's almost as if they know their jobs are unstable and have just stopped caring. I've never experienced such a lack of customer service skills in my life. It's as if your very presence is some sort of inconvenience. From the rude valet personnel and front desk staff to the pool Nazis demanding to see your papers (wristbands) just to walk in the pool area, it was just plain miserable. It felt like being in an airport where you have to constantly be ready to prove it's okay for you to be there. The property is pretty nice, although maybe a little gaudy and \"circus\" like for some. The rooms are okay, but nothing too special considering the price and the constant nickel and dining that guests receive ($25 just to park there). I really wanted to like this place and it has some positives, but I suggest potential guests stay somewhere else. It was honestly the one bad decision I made when I scheduled my trip to Maui. The rest of my trip was absolutely wonderful though! I highly recommend visiting Maui.",

The rooms are showing their age in terms of dinged and damaged furnishings, broken lamp shades. chips on walls and scratched, soiled painted surfaces. Cupboards not closing properly and calls for repairs unanswered. We even left the \"repair card\" which is deposited in each room by the staff to notify them of any problems and this was never tended to nor answered. The breakfast buffet has simply lost its quality and execution. Most foods tasted bland and were either under/overcooked. Mediocre at best considering the hi price you pair for breakfast each morning in the Grand Dining Room. My biggest grip and huge shock was to see the mistreatment and disregard for guests at the main pool area (adult). 14-16 casabellas each morning with eight louge chairs a piece usurped by the staff with white towels as \"reserved for paying guests\" . Well at $1000 a day it was no surprise that only 2-3 three of these casabellas were ever rented during our week stay. This in turn left approx 96 poolside chairs unavailable to the rest of the guests who were inconvenienced and displaced out onto the lawn when the few chairs that remained poolside were grabbed up by guests as early as 7a.m. Not a person in sight to assist guests when they had to shuttle chairs out onto the lawn since nothing was left poolside and again only 2-3 casabellas occupied with 8 chairs each UNUSED. This is ridiculous and a slap in the face to paying guests who are already shelling out a minimum of $500/nite to stay here. 96 chairs left unusable ALL DAY LONG just in case someone MIGHT rent them and NO ONE did. This is completely unacceptable, bad business and the poorest way to treat guests. We all understand the economy is bad, but should paying guests be put out, put off and displaced by the uncertain hope/wish that maybe just MAYBE someone will rent a casabella and take the 8 chairs, or should they make a policy that unless one is reserved by the night before or 9a.m. that morning the rest should be left open and the 8 chairs they contain available to all guests . This has left a huge distaste in my mind and feeling that we will not be returning let alone recommending others to visit. Its a shame, the place was once magnificent and held it guests with the highest regard, always very accomodating and offering to make you comfortable. This seems to have disappeared.",

        "content": "We were able to secure a rate of $285/ night for 4 nights. That was a discount from the regular $545 rate. The room was a nice room. But, I guess I expected to be wowed given the status of the Grand Wailea as *the* resort in Maui. The staff is incredible! The grounds are lush. The pool are clean and refreshing. There are separate areas for kids and adults. The beach is groomed each morning. Snorkeling right off the beach is enjoyable. But try to bring your own snorkel gear as itâ€™s $12/ day to rent it. Which brings me to the point of my review: paying for everything. WOW, the prices. Rum & Coke, $12. Mai Tai, $14. Bottled water, $5. Soda, $6.50. Hamburger w/ fries, $22. Cabanas, $300 for half day. Valet, $25/ day (no more free parking). Spa, $250 entry/access fee before you start picking treatments. Yes, I understand that itâ€™s not an all-inclusive. But after staying at Sandals and Beaches, we paid less than at Grand Wailea. I know this review goes against the grain of most reviews. But, after the flight and all the expense to stay at the resort, I guess I expected a little more for a little less. If you stay at the Grand Wailea, I do believe you WILL enjoy yourself â€“ we certainly did. But, the checkout bill will hurt.",

Very unprofessional to pay and be charged so much and I had to stand in line again with the same rude people to purchase a meal for my family. Very dissatisfied and not a fan of feeling like I didn't matter or that i was replaceable. Management should keep employees out of site and away IN UNIFORM. Ununiformed employees were also noticeable for they were openly speaking of their 30% employee discount that I was not granted and eligible for.

The Breakfast buffett was just so-so, recommend going to the Four Seasons if you enjoy a good breakfast.

People would stake out their chairs at dawn and there was no place to sit by noon. The water park is the big draw, and it was fun, but the thrill wore off quickly for our teenagers. We had stayed next door at the Wailea Beach Villas. There was no comparison. The Wailea Beach Villas rule!",

        "content": "i am going to tell you the things that i disliked first since i am assuming you need to have that information first this was a well deserved family vacation and I was prepared to spend money I had done my research about this hotel and was mentally prepared for sticker shock My children are a 15 yr old son and 10 yr old daughter - they loved the place. they are easily pleased as we usually are From their point of view, the pool and beach were fantastic and we certainly kept them busy- the concierge set us up with a car rental (disgustingly dirty and older model)snuba diving, snorkeling, Pearl Harbor, and a helicopter ride. I had already planned surfing lessons at Blue Hawaiin and the luau at Old Lahaina both were well worth the money and trip to lahaina. The thing that I can advise is plan ahead - dont waste a half a day with the concierge and it is more expensive through them. upon arrival we were greated by Rosie who was very friendly- you have probably read reviews about her- but she only said aloha Check in was a different story, being hilton honors members and taking 2 rooms for 10 nights didnt get us a thing we were in rooms 5118 and 5120 not a great view - too low if you are in this part of the hotel, you have to be ready to walk to the main pool and beach area it is far!! if you are having health issues definately ask for a closer room- you may go through the grand ballroom for your car but this is a very large hotel and spread out-the room was slightly dirty some mold in bathrooms but after talking to housecleaning they took care of it during turn down service - which i personally love I got sick there with strep throat and went to the clinic in kehei- they couldnt have been nicer at clinic however when we ordered room service that was an eye opener! expensive is too mild-holy cow for 1 mozzerella appetizer, four soups, house salads and 4 sodas i spent almost $180! then the second night my daughter got fish and chips with a bone in it that could've killed her! no exaggeration!! it was the size of a tooth pick and as sharp! they said that we wouldnt be charged but I am still fighting that one with them-the rush for the pool chairs is certainly true unless you are willing to pay $300/day for a cabana-which seem to take up all the space around all of the pools - you can get chairs however by the adult pool near the beach and the staff there were great they expected to be tipped but at least they smiled and made you feel good about spending money to sit down if you can get the breakfast buffet it is worth the money, although I must agree with reviews about the birds - too many and it is a health concern we watched them cr.. on the tables next to us the hotel should consider netting-one more thing - i booked photos with the hotel photographer, at sunset on our last day there - that didnt turn out well-he double booked and he tried to divide his time with us and them the other family complained quite loudly and took over the session - I am currently waiting to see if he gives us the discounted rate that he promised to - the hotel is absolutly breathtaking and there is a premium for that beauty one of the nicest places on the island of maui and the property is immaculately maintained the pools are fantastic and they even have manicure and pedicure services poolside along with popcorn and slushies! the restaurants are great but you would do better eating out if you are looking to save money somewhere hard rock in lahaina was really good and less then half the price of the grand wailea the pizza place across the street from hotel, matteos, was not new york pizza so we did not care for the sauce at all - plus im italian so its hard to compare any gravy to mine haha the overall feeling from the people on maui is laid back, kind and considerate great vibe from almost everyone i dont want you to think that we didnt have a fantastic time, we did i just thought that you would want to hear about these things so that you can be better prepared when you step off the plane onto paradise!",

        "content": "Staying at the Grand Wailea is definitely an experience. The grounds are phenomenal, the rooms are gorgeous and the staff is helpful and will do just about anything for their guests. The pools are spectacular. This resort is just about perfect. My family (2 kids ages 6 and 9) had a great time. However, perfection comes with a price. A standard mixed drink at the pool and lobby bar was $14.00. Regardless of price, if you are hanging out at the pool and use the slides from pool to pool, one should invest in the cool plastic Pineapple container for your drinks ($21.00 initially and $14.00 for cocktail refills). It has a handy sealed lid to keep your drink somewhat safe as you slide from pool to pool or if you drink too much. Once you get home, the pineapple doubles as a piggybank for the kids or your next trip back to the Grand Wailea. The Spa Grande is one of the nicest spas I have ever been to. The Terme baths are unique! Here's the stuff you may or may not care to know: The daily resort fee was $20.00 plus valet parking is mandatory at the resort at an additional $25.00 per day...not to mention every time you want your car, you have to fork over more money for a tip for the valet. Our room contained a king size bed and a pull out couch for the kids. The first night we had to put sheets on the pull out couch. Fortunately, the sheets and blanket were neatly sealed in a box in the closet. I am not super high maintenance but it would have been nice for the staff to recognize our reservation would be using the pull out couch and prepared accordingly for our arrival. The bed for my husband and I was super comfortable and we slept well but the mattress topper had obviously hills and valleys in it which to me indicates wear. Again, I am not the type who is going to demand for my bed to be ergonomically redesigned for my liking on vacation, so I just dealt with it. Other than my small complaints, The Grand Wailea is awesome. The Grand is not necessarily for those who are frugal like myself. However, I work hard and play even harder so the expense of staying at the Grand Wailea was completely justified in my eyes. I will be going back!",

The ocean view of Molokini was great, the over view of the property and also people watching is always fun. The staff at the hotel are very nice and always looking for someway to make your stay more enjoyable. We live on the other side of the island, but it was so nice to be pampered for the weekend.

Here's a tip - when you book your reservation, prior to your travel you will get a 2nd email from hotel with an area to submit an upgrade request. We used that link to upgrade, for free, to the Napua Tower. The Napua Tower is like the Executive Level. They have a good breakfast in the morning and appetizer in the evening. The service is great. House Keeping did a great job and our room was very clean. Another Tip - At The Whaler's General Store in The Shops at Wailea (a short drive/walk from the Hotel) you can pick up some reasonably priced snacks, drinks and deli. I was surprised the prices on most items were cheaper than the local super markets in Kihei. Finally, the greeter at the front (Rose Sumibcay) was very cool. She was very kind and engaging and my 9 year old daughter looked forward to seeing her everyday to \"talk story\". Solid Vacation --- Hope to be back next year.",

The pricing is what the pricing is and I feel that if you stay here you should have known that going in and thus you are not allowed to complain. I found the staff to be very pleasant individually but something just doesn't click here? It may be that it is so large that it all just doesn't connect, or come together as complete. The grounds are spectacular and easy to navigate, just be prepared to walk. Take in all that is around you, there is plenty to look at! The pool area was crowded but it was not a problem finding chairs, even after 11:00 am. There is limited space around any pool no matter how big, if you want to be pool front get up and get out! There was lovely lawn area with plenty of chairs and it was just fine and a short walk to the pools...just wear your $@!#% flops, as the walkway is sooo hot! Not the GW's fault! The beach is shared by 3-4 hotels and, though lovely, it is not huge and it gets packed!!! We went into the ocean but parked ourselves by pool and lawn. We ate at Humu and the pool area restaurant. Humu, with the $40 coupons was a fairly reasonable value and a great atmosphere. We had 3 rooms so we had $120 worth of coupons. Our dinner for 6, after coupons, was just over $200! This included some apps and drinks. Don't drink as much as us and use your free drink coupons with dinner, not before, and it is even less! We all felt it very good. The pool area food and bar was as expected, just fine. My daughter loved the spa treatment and, again after using the 20% off coupon, thought it was reasonable at about $125 for a 50 minute message and one hour use of other facilities included. The gym was large and we were there at peak time and waited for no machine. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We were in the back building and on the 6th floor and had a great view! I liked the bed though others with us thought they were to soft. If you take the down mattress cover off, or ask housekeeping to, it will be more firm. One thing to note, the lovely bathrooms were adorned with a throw rug that had no rubber backing in front of the sink!!! REMOVE IT if they have not yet changed them all out. I took a pretty good fall, after ignoring a slip or two prior. I was lucky to only twist my ankle and bruise my elbow pretty good- enough to miss my scheduled golf event with son. I can only imagine if it was someone older or less able to control the fall. I mentioned this to front desk and though my rug was immediately changed out to one with rubber backing the other two rooms we had were not! I was clearly not the first by the look on the faces of those I mentioned it to. Though I was looking for nothing, I was surprised by the apparent lack of concern when discussed with security. Would I stay again, yes I would. It was a lovely place.",

I browsed a few of them: \"Too much sun at the pool\"? \"Average food\"? \"You have to wear a wristband to use the pool\"? Who are these sad, little people? If more than usual sun exposure is a concern for you, then please: don't visit a tropical island for your vacation. My wife and I came here on our honeymoon, and we returned for our one year anniversary. When we informed them of this, they gave us an amazing (free) room upgrade and put a bottle of wine and a cheese plate in our room! The thing about the GW is there's NO reason to ever leave the property. You have beautiful beach, SEVEN swimming pools, a pool bar, and incredible restaurants. The layout of the hotel is awe-inspiring as well. Basically everything IS expensive, and it's because you're receiving the best of the best. Just down the beach are two other famous, upscale resorts: The Four Seasons and the Fairmont. While each are also impressive in their own ways, they just don't compare because the pools at the GW are so epic. There's amazing water slides and even a current-driven path that connects one pool to another. You can easily walk to any of the restaurants at other hotels. If you can afford it, why would you stay anywhere else?",

        "content": "If I had one word to describe the Grand Wailea Resort and Spa it would be â€œInconsistentâ€� This was our first trip to the Hawaiian island of Maui and the Grand Wailea Resort we had previously vacationed several times on the Big Island at Four Seasons Hualalai. We stayed 5 days and 4 nights the resort was at about 60 percent capacity. The strength of this property is the nice rooms, world class beach and water park pool area. Our room was clean the king bed was comfortable and the staff did a wonderful job keeping us stocked with towels. The beach is gorgeous and water park pool fun! Weakness included inconsistent customer service, food, grounds and employee attitudes, plus the ever present nickel and dime charging. My wife wasnâ€™t impressed by the spa she went for one treatment early in our trip and never returned. Warning: The stone area around the pool is slippery witnessed several adults and children slipping and falling on the stone tile surrounding the upper pool area. Also there is a lack of shade around the pools, so you need to get to the pool early in order to stake claim to a shaded standard lounge chairs. Beach goers need to arrive early before 9am to stake claim to one of the limited number of beach umbrella and lounge chairs available at no additional charge. The wind came up by noon each day so we would do the beach in the morning and the pool in the afternoon. Even with its short comings we had a good time, but I would only return to the Grand Wailea during non-peak travel times.",

        "content": "First impression is breathtaking. A welcome and lei is presented by bell staff, prior to arrival at the Front Desk. Check in was easy and quick , even though the hotel was busy due to spring break. After a warm welcome by the front desk staff, we were taken to our room which was spotless; and kept that way by hk for the entire stay. Room Service was the best and fairly priced. Dinner at the Mokikini Bistro was great, service was outstanding; and each child was presented with a free stuffed animal at the end of the meal. The beach is to die for, and there is no charge for the umbrellas. There is a \"Kids Club\" which provides activities and meals for the children, the staff goes out of their way to make the kids happy; and it is a great feature of this hotel. The team members at this resort are always anxious to help guests, and make them happy. This is where this hotel really shines. All of the team members have a great attitude. In conclusion , this really is the best resort on Maui.",

        "content": "I traveled from Honolulu with my wife and two young girls ages 6 and 8 during the week of March 20, 2011 for a five day vacation at the Grand Wailea. Upon arrival, the hotel was reportedly at about 90% occupancy. There are approximately 780 rooms to the Property. Assuming an average of 3.0 people per room this would equate to 2100 guests more or less exclusive of staff during our stay. The facilities and staff simply can not come close to servicing that amount of people to any degree, let alone to a four or five star level. The main attraction to the hotel, the pools and slides become so crowded and so chaotic by noon that it is difficult to imagine that after the initial pleasure of merely being in Hawaii wears off the mid west or east coast traveler, one doesn't feel stressed over fighting over towls and chairs and space. It is Lord of the Flies at $1,000 a day. By 7:45 am 95% percent of the chairs around the multi level pool complex are completely taken. By 8:00 am 100% are taken. No one is actually using the pool or is even at the pool at that hour however. The one hour policy to \"reserve\" your chair is not enforced and in fact I actually witnessed on Friday March 25 at approx 11:00 am two young girls ages 8 and 10 , who had claimed two chairs and were quietly sitting next to me (which had been cleared by security about 30 minutes prior due to a guest placing a book there at approx 7:00 am and quickly disappearing) removed by hotel security because the guest returned 4 hours later and claimed he had BEEN USING THE CHAIR- A BLATANT AND OBVIOUS LIE. THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE SCARED, THE 5FT 10 260LB WHITE MALE GOT HIS CHAIR BACK,because the hotel secuity made the expedient decision after looking at thesize of the belligerent male and then the two little innocent girls who would be easier to deal with and the young girls had their day ruined. You could provide that friendly spring break experience for your kids without spending a 1,000 dollars a day for room and meals! Thank God the girls parents were not there at the time or there might have been a stabbing! So much for the blind eyes of Justice! Not once by the pool in five days did a server ever ask if we were interested in placing a food order. When we did eat by the pool the food was horrible. I do not mind the prices but the food was horrendous. The rooms were fair but can not compare to any four star or five star hotel in Kona, Lanai, or even next door at the Four Seasons. It is not enough for Management to say that occupancy is 90% and things get tight. A hotel need that number in order to make money so obviously the business plan for this Hotel coupled with the size and design do not provide functional utility for the guests ,and hence, this hotel constitutes a very poor value and a terrible waste of money. Management, let me tell you something: from 7am to 10 am the amount of people that are actually using the pool and need to legtimately \"claim\" a chair for immediate use is around zero. Issue towels and chairs at 10:00am and not earlier before someone gets killed!!!",

        "content": "My family recently stayed at the Grand Wailea for a week and we had a really nice time. We loved the resort location and we were really pleased with our room. We had a Deluxe Ocean View room that was nice and spacious, had a decent sized balcony and had great views of the ocean and pool area. Our room was very clean and the property seemed clean the entire week we were there. As others have mentioned, the rooms are pricey and everything at the resort was expensive, but it wasn't a surprise....most places in Maui are pretty pricey. We have a 3 year old son who travelled with us and he had a ball at the pool. There was so much to do (even for little ones). The spa is amazing and is a must-do for anyone who stays at or anywhere near the resort. In general we had a fantastic time, but we did make note of a couple of things that could be improved upon: - One downside to the pool was the limited number of pool chairs. People get in line at 7am to claim their pool chairs and some people leave them unoccupied for hours. The rule is one hour only, but on most days we saw chairs being left unoccupied for 2-3 hours. - Prior to our vacation we called and asked about cabana rentals and were told we wouldn't need to book a cabana in advance, that it could be booked when we arrived. Regardless of that information, we called the week before our vacation and booked a cabana near the baby beach. When we arrived at the resort we called to confirm the cabana rental and were told that they had no record of our cabana reservation. We figured they'd be a little apologetic, but they really weren't. We were then told that people book the cabanas months in advance (which was completely different from what we were told weeks prior to our trip). The upside was we saved $250 in the cabana rental for that day! - The food and drink service at the pool was hit or miss. We went an entire day without anyone coming to take a drink order. Late in the afternoon, we saw a server and my husband asked her if she could come over to get our drink order and she did, but with zero enthusiasm and customer service skills that most servers at a resort of this caliber would display. On other days we had great pool service so i guess it really just depends on the server. Everyone else at the resort was extremely friendly and our overall experience was great. We had such a lovely time we definitely plan to go back and we would stay at the Grand Wailea again.",

        "content": "I read all of these reviews before deciding on the Grand Wailea for a week with my family, which includes young children. Yes, it is pricey and you should not go if you can't stomach paying $20 for a cocktail, but it was totally worth it for us. The location is amazing, the beach is perfect and close (unlike the Fairmont and Four Seasons) and the pools are heaven for young kids. Nothing else compares to the pool scene here. The Fairmont and Four Seasons are more grown up and elegant in my opinion, but this is not what we wanted with young children. You can tell the resort was built in the early 90s and definitely needs a little updating (the peach paint on the exterior is cheesy), but the grounds are beautiful and huge. Until our children are older, we would not change a thing as they had the time of their lives. The fridge in our room was complimentary by the way. The room was decent and clean but not huge. You could see some wear and tear in the bathrooms, so updating will likely happen in the near future, one would hope. But these were all minor complaints as we had a fabulous holiday here. Our breakfast was included and we loved the buffet at the grand dining room every morning. I had a mediocre massage at the spa, but the baths there were lovely. Highly recommend this hotel to families. If you are a stickler for perfection, go to the Four Seasons, where the scene is little more quiet and grown up. The Grand Wailea was heavenly for us.",

        "content": "We stayed here for 10 days from Jan 15 to Jan 25. It was our first trip to Maui and our purpose was to relax. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds with water features and sculptures everywhere. The lush gardens are constantly being worked on - we thought they were beautifully kept. The hotel's facilities were wide ranging: the extensive pools were fantastic fun for all ages. There was staff located at each rapid, or at the tarzan swing from 10am to 5pm for safety. The rapids and slides are closed outside of these times - but there was plenty of other pool space to enjoy after that. We were able to get sun beds every day at our leisure - there was no annoying reserving of stuff at 6.30 am. The Spa Grande was a lovely experience. We took the special deal $149 which gave an hour's use of the spa baths/saunas etc before a 50min massage (included $25 toward a lunch/dinner at Molokini bistro). I thought this was an enjoyable and indulgent experience - both our masseurs were great. Make sure you get there an hour before your massage to use the different baths and saunas etc. The gym was excellent for a hotel - better equipped than some professional gyms! There are some gym classes but some you have to pay an extra $10 eg. spin classes. The yoga classes are complimentary. Give it a go even if you're a beginner. I liked the 7am beach yoga with no-nonsense Nancy. Our room was in the lagoon wing on the 1st floor. Great king size bed, beautiful bathroom - all kept clean. Wifi in room. Everything good quality and worked. Amazing sunsets. Breakfast in the Grand Dining room - a huge buffet with American/European/Hawaiian/Japanese dishes and an egg station. During our 10-day stay we were always able to choose something we liked from the buffet. Staff was quick to refill, in our experience. Egg guy was great. We found the staff at Grand Wailea to be friendly and non-intrusive (which is how we like it). I suppose I could go on - but the review is already a bit rambling. On the whole we had an amazing stay - something for everyone. The one annoyance was the $25 daily resort fee. You know of course before you book. I liked the fact that you didn't have to go with the valet parking at $20 a day but you could self-park and this was included in the $25 fee. They have now changed this arrangement and you have to take the valet parking at $20 p/day and the resort fee has been reduced to $20 p/day. Just take this in to account when you are looking at the daily cost of staying at this hotel.",

        "content": "Rooms: We got a basic garden view room, it was the least expensive, but did not seem cheep in any way. I asked about an upgrade and was told they were at 100% occupancy with none available. We were in the Chapel wing on the first floor and I must say the room was amazing. I was very impressed. The bed was very comfortable, the room, bathroom, patio, were huge, and very well appointed. Beautiful bathrooms, beautiful furniture, and we even had a waterfall near our door in one of the many amazing gardens. Humuâ€™s: I got a Mai Tai, which normally I am not a fan of when they give them out at most Hawaiian hotels, but this was highly recommended by some other guests; letâ€™s just say I am a fan of Humuâ€™s Mai Tais. Wow! The service was impeccable, attentive, and knowledgeable. The food was all good. I recommend the Ahi Traps. Resort food tends to be expensive, thought the GWâ€™s food wasnâ€™t outrageously expensive, it was actually less than I expected. (Please donâ€™t use this as a cue to raise your prices). Pools: For being at 100% occupancy, the hotel sure did not feel crowded. They really did a great job of laying things out, having a variety of pools, etc. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it was pretty crowded, but it still felt personable, lots of small pool areas, etc. Most of the chairs were taken if we didnâ€™t rush out at 6am, but we eventually found two chairs together both days. Also, be sure you go to the activities desk and get a wrist band each day. We didnâ€™t know this our first day, and security will ask you to leave if you donâ€™t have one. I guess people try to sneak in from the Four Seasons or the Marriott? There were a lot of children, though Hawaii is a family destination, so we expected this. Most were very well behaved, supervised by parents, etc. But I feel I need to warn others who are looking for more of an adult only retreat, thought they did have an adult only pool, but that was more crowded than others. The pools are fun. They have a network of waterslides connecting the pools and even have a water elevator if you donâ€™t want to climb the stairs. I donâ€™t think I have been to a water park type place in over 20 years; letâ€™s just say I had a lot of fun. Many other adults were partaking in the waterslides too. Pool/Food/Bars: We have stayed in a lot of resort type places over the past few years, and the GW is defiantly in the top two to three. The staff is so nice and helpful, very personable. The drinks by the pool are reasonably priced for a resort of this caliber, and they do not skimp on the alcohol. The food was amazing, even with pool side service. The pool side service is slow, but the wait staff always told us what the expected time would be, as they prepare all of the food fresh. They also have a grotto bar that you swim up too. Itâ€™s inside a cave with flowers growing out of the walls, amazing! Though the music gets loud later in the day, but they have tables outside the bar as well, also in the water. We had such a great time at the GW and canâ€™t wait to go back. It was an amazing experience, beautiful grounds which we walked for hours, amazing hospitality, and everything was just designed really well. There is shopping on site, and an outdoor mall within walking distance. They have activities on site, though we didnâ€™t participate in much on this stay. We did go to the marine station and learn about whales. But we were more into relaxing and hanging by the pool and walking on the beach.",

        "content": "Stayed here October 2010 with a conference. The conference rate was substantially below the rack rates for the rooms. Grounds are fantastic- one of the nicest hotels I've ever been to, and I have traveled a fair amount. Truly impressive- especially the pools, which may be some of the nicest in the world. They have a lei greeting and an impressive entrance. I was a little disappointed when we checked in, because the person at the front desk gave me a hard time about the room type. I brought my wife with me and the room type was a big deal for us- this was both a late anniversary celibration and her birthday was the final day of our trip. We wanted it to be special. I used to have a fairly decent Hilton Hhonors level status, but we have two young kids and I lost it since I haven't traveled as much since they were born. I mention this because as with any other hotel, your status matters in how they treat you. Since our conference rate was the same price for a variety of room types, this issue probably wouldn't apply to those who pay a set price for a specific room type. I booked way ahead to reserve a 'deluxe oceanfront' room. A colleague with higher Hhonors status who booked when only garden view rooms were available requested an oceanfront room (right next to me in line) and they gave it to him without hassle. The person at the counter gave me a garden room and then told me three times that room types are not guaranteed. I was getting ready to ask for a manager when she finally (reluctantly) agreed to give me the room type I booked. I would understand if she said it once to make the point, but I just traveled 15 hours from the east coast to get there, and I expect that if the hotel can simply accomodate the request I made, that they do so without hassling me. Although the start was rocky, the rest of the stay improved. Again, the grounds are fantastic. Amazing. The room itself was nice, but not commensurate with the price of the hotel. I would have been a little disappointed if we paid full price. As many other reviews state, you are paying for the grounds. They're worth it. Our view was not as good as a couple of other oceanfront rooms on site that my colleagues got, but I did have an ocean view and that was good enough. Our room had a shower and large (non-jetted) tub and a balcony with a table and chairs. The pictures on the website seem to be fairly accurate- this is not always the case with some hotels, but what you see is what you get here. This room would have been expected in a standard hilton beach property, but not in a waldorf astoria. It is due for a remodel in the rooms. I had emailed in advance about a fridge for the room because food is EXPENSIVE on and near the property. Get a rental car, because a cab is about $60 each way to/from the airport and there is great food fairly reasonably priced in Kihei about 5 miles down the road. Parking was a little annoying- the parking garage is a quarter mile down the road if you don't want to pay for the valet. The on-site eating options are good, but quite expensive. We had dinner at humuhumunukunukuapuaa and it was very nice. My wife had lobster and steak, and I had sushi and fresh fish ceviche. Both were nicely prepared. They told me the fridge would be $25 for the whole stay. When I checked in, they said $5 delivery charge plus $8 a day. Then when we checked out after five nights, there was an almost $80 charge (no idea where they got this figure)! The front desk happily adjusted it to $25 when I showed the email that I got from the hotel representative. The worst part- the fridge was already in the room the whole time!!! All they did was come in and use a key to unlock the cabinet where it was stored. On the second day of our stay, we noticed that the fridge had frozen our items. The milk was a hard slush, beers were nearly frozen, everything else was inedible because it was too cold. Tried turning down the thermostat, that only made it worse. Everything froze hard, so we couldn't use the milk for our coffee and I was afraid the glass beer bottles would explode if I took them out by hand. I mentioned the problem to the front desk and they volunteered to get us a new fridge and replace all the food items right away. They replaced the beer, milk, and cream. We also had bought guacamole dip and french onion dip at the grocery store. They replaced them with fresh guacamole and had the chef whip us up some french onion dip using Maui sweet onions. I mention the fridge incident not because I hold it against the hotel that the first fridge broke, but because it shows that they do take the effort to try and fix problems when they occur. Although we had a rough day without our coffee, the effort the hotel made to fix it made up for the problem. The dips were delicious! When not at the conference, we did the typical tourist stuff (road to hana, sunrise at the volcano, etc.). But I spent the most (non-work) time at the pool. The slides and lazy river are great! Spent some time (and a few bucks) at the grotto bar. If you pay a little extra, you can get a big pineapple mug that holds a lot more than the other cups and you get a whole lot more drink for you money the rest of your trip. I didn't figure this out until too late. Speaking of drink deals, there was a (unadvertised, as far as I could tell) happy hour in the main bar in the middle of the hotel from 5-6 with a serious discount on mai tais. The beach in front of the hotel is pristine. Swimming there is comfortable and safe. We booked a snorkeling trip to two sites- Molokini crater and turtle town. Drove a half hour north of the hotel to get to the boat (boss frogs, which was inexpensive and great), and they went to molokini first. Then, turtle town ended up being directly in front of the hotel!!! If you have (or rent) snorkel gear, you can easily check out the turtles on the southern end of the beach in front of the hotel. You can swim or kayak out just a little bit and see the turtles surfacing. Some were almost as big as a vw beetle. My wife visited the spa on her birthday and loved it. The locals had told us (when we mentioned where we were staying) that our hotel had the best spa on the island. My wife didn't try any others, but certainly enjoyed this one very much. In summary, the grounds were amazing, the room was nice (if not quite up to our expectations), and expect to pay extra for everything. The location in Wailea is great. Stay here, but don't expect to do so frugally! We had a wonderful trip and while there were a couple of things that could have been done better, the hotel generally met or exceeded our expectations and we would stay here again.",

        "content": "As a diamond HHonors member we were upgraded to a top floor ocean view room. We were staying on points and free night vouchers. The Grand Wailea is on a nice beach. In Sept. it never seemed crowded at the beach or pools. I really thought the pools and beach were nicer than other Wailea properties nearby. The property, common areas, spa, were all very nice. The grounds were lovely and while we were there it was obvious that a lot of care and attention goes into keeping it that way. Lucky I read another review where the couple found a coupon in the in room magazine for the spa....around $150 for an hour in the baths (which there are several, shower of different kinds, sauna), a 50 min. massage, and lunch at Bistro Molokini. With tip, tax, and a t-shirt with the spa logo it came to around $200. Without the coupon it would have started at around $200. I really did enjoy the baths, massage and lunch. My spouse couldn't justify the expense so to each his or her own. Our room was very comfortable and the view was gorgeous. It was quite a hike to the self park from our room on the other side of the resort, but that was fine. Other than Bistro Molokini, which is a bar and cafe out by the pools, we ate on property at the cafe located in the shops at Grand Wailea for lunch ( note is has strange hours and not open every day). We rented a refrigerator for $7 a day, which saved us quite a bit on breakfasts. We found provisions at the natural foods grocery, Mana Foods in Paia. I liked that little town. Has some nice shopping and restaurants like the Paia Fish Market (casual cafe on the corner...Ono burger was great) and good art galleries. Drove the road to Hana, went north to Lahaina, and up Haleakala Mountain (about a 10K elevation gain and great views). Really liked Maui and the Grand Wailea.",

        "content": "Came to Grand Wailea on a honeymoon for 6 days after coming from the St Regis on Kauai, and boy what a difference. I know its not exactly fair to compare a different hotel chain from a different island, but we paid similar money to stay at both, with similarly nice accomodations. St Regis Kauai is head and shoulders above in terms of service, grounds upkeep, and exclusivity. You can relax there, not worry about racing for good seats, there are not 1000's of screaming children and pushy adults. I just dont know how else to describe it other than \"down market,\" which is not how a hotel in this price range should feel, in my opinion. The good: Our room was awesome, we were on the 5th or 6th floor and we were upgraded to oceanview room with terrace. Room was perfectly nice, although our couch was a bit stodgy. Otherwise an A+. Room service despite not serving 24hrs (which lets be real people at these prices and on maui, this should be available) was pretty good and we used them several times. Great views from the room. The beach was nice (if you could get on it). The pools/slides are cool. The grounds are very nice in certain areas where the original hotels grandeur has been preserved, such as the lobbys and entrance and some of the outer grounds/gardens. Its beautiful to walk around at night. There is a nice long path that runs along the hotel beach and goes past many other hotels, nice for a walk in the morning or sunset. Good snorkeling can be found near by, we swam with sea turtles and saw lots of fish. And the highlight of our trip was SHANE THE BARTENDER, WHO ROCKED . HE KNEW US BY NAME AND WELCOMED US WARMLY each time we popped by for a drink. He would remeber what we drank last and was very good. Unfortunately, he was the only one who we got this type of service from at this hotel (and in comparison, when at the st regis, there were several employees throughout the resort who knew us by name and were outgoing and friendly.) Big difference to me. The Bad: I was here 10 yrs ago, and let me tell you there has been alot of change. All these glowing reviews of this place must be from first time travelers to this hotel. If they had the priviledge to see this place in its glory, they would have a better idea of whats gone wrong with this place. The hotel itself is basically the same, except everything seems worn and dirty: pathways are dirty and falling apart in some areas, there are wood banisters in some spots that need some up keep or paint or to be redone, or something. The grandiose gardens that I came back for are not as well kept, and there are plants that are really beat up and half dying. They need to be replaced. The grass along the walkways is worn out and its dirt or yellow/dead in many places. they try to cut and paste new grass is but it just doesnt look right. The water by the restaurant on the tropical lagoon is atrocious looking, I was concerned for the fish they had in it (and in the grand scheme of things these might not be such a big deal, and I am being critical, but only because I saw the real Grand Wailea Hotel and Spa, and know how far its fallen. Several times we tried to call down to the concierge and the phone just rand and rang and rang. I spoke to several peope who are \"members\" allowing them special rates and frequent visits and they agreed that the place has taken a turn for the worse.) There is just a major vibe of corner cutting, and just maintaing what they have, to milk it for as much money as they possibly can, without investing anything more money into it. OK NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE UNPLEASANT POOL/BEACH SCENE. I love the pools at this place. However, there are just too many people on this property. WHERE DO ALL THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?!!?!?!?!?!? The management is dropping the ball here big time. Finding a free chair can be a nightmare. There are lines for towels, which are needed to claim a chair. People line up at ungodly hours to be first. They say they clear the towels off the chairs if people dont come down after an hour, but I didnt see this happen once. The pool/beach staff was not friendly at all. I was told these hotel gigs are hard to get on Maui and are well liked by the locals, apparently not! The loungers and chairs around the pools are stacked so closely there may not even be an inch between them, and in some places they go 3 or 4 rows deep. I felt like I was sitting on the expressway, in rush hour, only in a lounge chair with palm trees around me, and a melted 20 odd dollar pinacolada. And dont let them tell you they are at max capacity, because this hotel is huge and was not filled if we were getting free oceanview room upgrades. The scam here is, they built this huge condo complex (Hoelei? or something)across the street, and to get people to stay there, they allow them full access to the Grand Wailea pools and grounds. These people seem to bring kids by the dozen. Its screaming kids all day. I felt like I was at a six flags water park, not an alleged 4 star resort upscale resort. So you basically have 2 resorts worth of people on one property. NO WONDER THE PLACE IS SO OVER CROWDED. SO HERE I AM WITH MY VERY HIGH ROOM RATE AND 20$ COCKTAIL, STRUGGLING TO FIND A SEAT ANYWHERE NEAR A BODY OF WATER, WEDGED IN TRAFFIC 3 ROWS BACK FROM THE POOL AND IM STUCK BEHIND/PUSHED OUT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EVEN HOTEL GUESTS!!!!!!!! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!!!!! but this is not a problem, just simply rent one of there 300 dollar a day poolside huts and you will not have to worry. Service is so so poolside. Did I mention the screaming kids yet? haha! This place has sold its soul in my opinion, I dont even want to get into the beach scene, which was actually a little better. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, wishing I had never left the st regis. I will never be back. I gave 3 stars because the grounds are still somewhat nice in comparison to most properties and the pools are still cool. If you walked around this place at night after all the cattle go back to the barn, and the darkness covers up the blemishes, its a beautiful place. We just spent alot of time off the property and hung in our room so we could have some peace and quiet. Something that there is a severe shortage of here. Do yourself a favor and go to the 4 Seasons, the Ritz or Kea lani if your coming to Maui. We were watering at the mouth walking past the Marriot Outrigger resort which is down the beach path from the GW. Things looked so peaceful and realxing and serent there. Chairs were spaced out appropriately. This place needs to lower its prices and have there 4 star rating removed. We still managed to have a great time here, but beware! Things are not the same here anymore. If we do come back we'll stay at the Marriott a few doors down or the Ritz in Kaplua or 4 seasons next door. Both looked serene and could be had for less money, except the 4 seasons. BOTTOM LINE: THE GRAND WAILEA IS A ZOO AND THE HOTEL HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE!!!! IF YOU MUST GO, IT BETTER BE DURING THE SLOWEST PART OF THE SEASON THERE. LOOK ELSEWHERE, UNLESS YOU ARE A FAMILY WITH & KIDS AND PLAN TO STAY AT THE CONDO PLACE HOELEI ACROSS THE STREET. GOOD LUCK!",

        "content": "The Front Desk: When we first arrived at the Grand Wailea, we had 2 separate rooms, so we had two different desk clerks. One of them was NOT nice!! I think some previous reviewers mentioned the lack of courtesy before. When you are spending almost $400+ per night for a BASIC room, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE SMILING AND KIND!!! Not the case. The clerk did her job, but was not pleasant and never once even cracked a smile. The other clerk was very nice and accommodating and he ended up upgrading our room to an ocean view. Several other desk clerks were also very friendly, but I feel like at this level of hotel, there should be absolutely no exceptions. The Rooms: They were very spacious and pretty nice. We had a room with double queen beds. The bathroom was huge, mostly marble, and the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom and had a separate door, which I really liked. There was a large soaking tub and a separate shower with a little bench. Good water pressure and plenty of space for your things. Great little mango/honey shower gels and shampoo/conditioners. Usually, I ignore the hotel samples, but these were very nice. There was a large flat screen TV in the room and plantation shutters that kept out most of the light if you wanted to sleep in. You could also sleep with the windows open and the screen door closed, so no bugs got in. Maid service was annoying, but efficient. They just came way too early, so we had to use the do not disturb sign every day. The carpets did look like they could stand to be replaced. They weren't dirty, but again, for the price of the rooms, we expected better. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were great. I slept well every night. The hotel: The hotel is extremely ornate and has a lot of beautiful elements. Statues all over the place, flowers all over the place, they've clearly put a LOT of money into making this hotel spectacular. That being said, we went down the street to the Four Seasons to have a drink and it was sheer understated elegance. We didn't go into any of the guest rooms, but the common areas were just gorgeous and classy. While the GW is not OVERstated, we agreed that it IS stated. If we were to spend that type of money again, we would probably go to the Four Seasons. In addition, the GW property is HUGE. There is a long walk pretty much anywhere you go. I think we were pretty central to everything, but it took at least 3-5 minutes to walk anywhere. I would have hated to have had one of the less central rooms. It was mostly ok because the weather was pleasant, but at times it was just a pain in the butt. There were times when I would bring things for later just so I didn't have to walk to get back to the room. The pools: There are a ton of pools on the property, but we only used the adult pool, which was nice. There were a lot of slides all over, which would be a lot of fun for kids, but we weren't sure if there was an age or height limit and it didn't appear that they were used too much by adults, so we never used them. Never too crowded (we went the week after the Labor Day holiday) and the pool had a beautiful fountain. You could get as many towels as you liked, but they did ask for your name and room number before giving you anything. It wasn't a long process. The beach: The beach behind the pools is GORGEOUS. We had the use of free beach chairs and umbrellas while at the beach and the sand out there was just supersoft and beautiful. It's a golden color, so it's darker than what I normally see, but I got used to it very quickly. There was very little debris in the sand or the water and it made swimming in the ocean a joy. I would walk down the beach next door to the front of the Four Seasons property and enjoy the view from there. Just stunning. The spa: Spa Grande is FABULOUS!!! The facilities are great and I didn't have enough time to fully enjoy them to the extent I wanted. Think Burke Williams within a resort. There are 5 different baths with different salts, eastern and western hot and cold pools, a steam room, sauna and several other amenities. Make sure you ask for a tour of the facility so you know where everything is. And get there at least an hour before your service so you can enjoy it. If I did it again, I'd allow myself an hour and a half to two hours because I like to do repeats. They also give you a free 5 minute exfoliation if you are receiving a service. This is a great way to ensure that all of the guests are clean before they use the amenities (you are still required to shower first). I got an 80 minute massage that wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was perfectly fine and I felt extremely relaxed afterward. One thing that was REALLY annoying about the spa is that the staff was constantly walking around calling names of guests who had services scheduled. When you are trying to relax in the steam room or a bath or something, the last thing you want to hear is someone else's name repeated over and over (rather loudly, I might add). They should take a hint from Burke Williams and require folks to report to one area 5 minutes prior to their service. That way, the other guests are not disturbed. They came to get me a full 10 minutes prior to my service. I needed my 10 minutes and still made it upstairs in enough time that I had to wait for my masseuse. The food: It's extremely expensive. Extremely. We had lunch once at the restaurant closest to the Hibiscus Pool (I forget the name) and the food was very average. Definitely not worthy the price. We had dinner one night at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (named after the fish) and it was pretty good, but again, very pricey. We were having a birthday celebration and had asked for seating to see the sunset, but we didn't feel like the seating we got was optimal. In fact, when we spoke to the person making the reservation, she told us the sun set at 7:30pm when it was fully below the horizon at 6:30!! A couple of the servers were great, though, and we had fun with them. We mostly ate off property, including The Shops down the street. We really enjoyed Longhi's for breakfast and we also ate at the place next door to it (something about burgers), but didn't enjoy the food or the service nearly as much as Longhi's. One day, my friend and her dad had the $50 buffet brunch, which they said was decent. They did mention that the view from the buffet was spectacular. I went driving up a mountain instead, so I missed it. :) We also had dinner at Nick's Fishmarket, which had delicious food and stellar service and we tried Pacifico's in Lahaina (worth the 45 minute drive -- if you go, be sure to get some shaved iced from Ululani's). Our first night, we ate at Cafe Olei (sp?), which we didn't particularly enjoy. The expensive food was average to below, with a less than average atmosphere at a strip mall. It was recommended to us by the valets at the hotel. Bad choice, skip it. The concierge service: On one day, I spent over 3 hours going back and forth with the concierge about activity plans. It was my most frustrating, non-enjoyable day. I wanted to go to Road to Hana, but the people I was with didn't want to go, so the concierge (who sounded like she knew her stuff) told me there were less touristy, more spiritual things to do there. We agreed to connect an hour later and when I showed up, she was the only concierge out of 4 of them who was busy. After waiting for 30 minutes and seeing the people going nowhere, I finally asked her to call me when they were done because I wanted to get in some time in the sun. Of course, she called as soon as I settled in my lounge chair. She said I needed to come back up so she could show me some places on a map, so I headed back up. The call soon dropped and she didn't call back. When I called back, I was told she was busy with other guests. I walked up soon after and she started apologizing profusely for having to leave!!! I couldn't believe she had taken an hour break, then came back, helped other people and left without helping me!! She passed me off to another concierge who gave me incorrect directions, even though I asked her repeatedly whether she knew where she was going and told her I didn't want to drive for 45 minutes to get lost. She seemed very unsure of herself. I had to ask her a thousand questions over the course of about an hour just to get any relevant information. And guess what? I never found the location. She claimed she would send up a more detailed map, but the map she sent up was less detailed than the one she showed me at the desk!! Completely useless!! And none of them seemed to know about the black sand beach 10 minutes down the road!! I just don't get how these people can hold these jobs and know practically nothing about what's going on and where things are ... I definitely expected more from such a highly rated hotel, but I was completely disappointed.... Overall, though I enjoyed my visit, I wouldn't stay at this resort again ... it's too expensive for what you get and there are plenty of other really nice places to stay in the area.... but I will DEFINITELY be back to Maui ... it's awesome!!!",

These guys offer an adult only pool where you can carry your drinks, kiss in the pool, whatever. Hint: I think you can get a garden view (if your room overlooks the chapel) that is the closest to the pool and beach. I may not spend the $$ for the deluxe ocean view next time. The people were great, service was great, I have no complaints. The hotel can get very crowded, so maybe people complain about the service during those times. I did not each dinner there but once, the view was great from the steakhouse, but the food was so/so at best. At night, get in the rent a car and go out to each, there are many great places.",

        "content": "Stayed at the Grand Wailea for 4 nights last week. Last time I was in Wailea a few yrs ago I stayed at the FS, so I am somewhat jaded. This hotel is enormous....almost 800 rooms! Everything seemed like a hike. Was a 5-10 min walk from my room just to get to the pool. Felt I was nickel and dimed at check in. $25 resort fee. $10 luggage transfer fee. $3 maid gratuity fee. All this on top of my nightly rate. Didn't find staff to be too polite or accomodating. They need some lessons from their neighbors down the beach (FS & Fairmount). Anytime I asked a question, they made me feel like I was harassing them. Would not stay here again and would not recommend to anyone...even families....there are plenty of other resorts in HI that'll cater to children. You don't need to spend your money at this place. The biggest joke was the line of people (40 deep) waiting to get towels prior to the pool opening at 7 AM. It stressed me out just looking at them from my beachside yoga class. This is not a 5 star property, or anything close to luxurious. Conrad Hilton would be rolling over in his grave if he knew the GW was associated with his chain.",

        "content": "\"Brokedown Palace\" best describes this place to me. I think the glory days for the GW are long gone. It's still on a beautiful beach and the pool is nice if you don't mind 5000 screaming kids like Disneyworld. During our visit there must have been some sort of Fred Durst family convention going on LOL I swear, every guy there had a backwards baseball cap, a goatee or soul patch (!) and had tons of kids in tow. The whole grounds, pool area and all the patios (especially on the ground floor) looked like they had been hit with a tidal wave of inflatable toys, boogie boards, towels, food, soda bottles and trash. I have nothing against kids, but this place markets itself as a romantic high-end luxury property (with prices to match) but in reality it is more like a huge 3 1/2 star Disney hotel aging in a beautiful location. Did I mention most of the Durst clones were sloppy drunk at the pool by 1PM? A true Durster wouldn't even get up until 1PM. Amateurs ;) They should lower their prices and lower their guests expectations. The prices at GW are still very high and there are many other beachfront hotels that are less expensive and will probably offer the same experience for less $. If you are looking to spend big bucks for a romantic luxury trip of a lifetime and you want a true 5 star experience, you will be much happier at the Four Seasons next door or the Ritz in Kapalua. I've stayed at both and both are a thousand times nicer than Grand Wailea.",

        "content": "I am writing this review because I feel it could be very beneficial to not only family vacations but also corporate and incentive travel groups. I have worked in the hospitality industry over the past 30 years and currently own and operate a Destination Management Company in Scottsdale Arizona. Service is the key to my success and anytime I travel, I am always evaluating those who I encounter. I recently took a family vacation to Grand Wailea Resort on the island of Maui. I can not express enough what a wonderful time we had. The room was spacious and had all the necessary amenities to enhance our stay. My kids, 10 & 12 are still talking about the Tarzan Swing, Water Slides and Water Elevator. My wife on the other hand enjoyed a message by the adult pool. During one of the evenings, I noticed that a group was having a private Luau on the beach. What a spectacular setting, over looking the ocean with the sun setting. Even though Arizona is known for it sunsets, there is no comparison to what I experienced in Maui! The service at the hotel was outstanding, from the pool service to the front desk. As I had mentioned, being in the industry, sometimes I can be a little demanding. Not once did anyone say no or even give me a reason to think twice. Upon check-out, we needed to vacate our room due to a large group checking in. Since our plane did not depart until 10:30PM, the front desk clerk suggested that we enjoy the pool facilities and than come back to the desk and they would give us a hospitality room to change. In closing, I would highly recommend the Grand Wailea Resort to anyone who is looking for a beautiful hotel, with impeccable service, unbelievable sunsets and wonderful recreational activities, than this is the hotel for you!

However, the first day there my husband and I got up early (6:30 a.m) due to time change and urge to walk the awesome cliff walk. When we got to the beach we saw a line resembling the running of the brides at Filene's Basement in Boston (except it was coed). We were puzzled and asked what everyone was lining up for. The response was that everyone was there to claim their chairs! I told my husband that I REFUSED to enter that rat race and line up at 6:30 to get a chair. Well, that was a mistake as I ended up laying on my towel on the beach at a $700 a night resort! I felt like I was back in HS! The elderly couple next to me was in the same predicament and I watched in horror as the gentlemen struggled to get up from the sand. The pool area resembled a scene from CNN showing the tent cities in Haiti. People were elbow to elbow with towels, rafts, etc strewn about. The resort is beautiful and the beach is glorious, however, I don't understand why this chair scene is more competitive than the Wall Street Job Market! Why don't they have enough chairs for everyone or why can't they stop people from \"saving their spot\" all day?",

What do you dream of when you go to a tropical island? Beautiful white sand beach with great beach activities? Warm tropical breezes and sunny skies? Great, friendly staff ready to satisfy your every request? So many pools to explore with slides and caves- and a swim up bar with Richie shaking up frosty cocktails? Incredible grounds with amazing tropical flowers, beautiful artwork around every corner- fabulous food in a thatched hut restaurant where you are suspended over a tropical aquarium- oh and the spa- heavenly! Does it all sound over the top? Maybe- but the GW is one of the most incredible hotels I have ever experienced. We were treated like queens- upgraded to a beautiful ocean view room in the Chapel Wing, had champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries from the hotel delivered to the room for my birthday. The only bummer was the guy in the next room who took a 5am conference call on the speaker phone for three days in a row- but one small blemish in paradise I can overlook. We will be back...as many times as we can!! Highly recommend taking a day trip to Piiholo Ranch for the Zipline- amazing, breathtaking, soooo fun!",

        "content": "We stayed at the Grand Wailea in early Jan/10. It really is a beautiful hotel on a beautiful stretch of beach. Room We had a few problems with our room during our stay - the toilet broke, the safe broke, and the TV broke...seems like alot of problems for a room during a 7 day stay. I will say, however, that they very promptly responded to the concerns and fixed the toilet and safe very promptly...although the safe malfunctioned again at the end of our stay, we didn't bother to raise the issue again. The TV never was fixed properly - every 15 min, we had to jiggle the coaxial wire when the TV signal was lost; this after 2 service calls. however, we didn't spend much time watching TV so it wasn't a big deal. In my opinion for a hotel of this class (and price), I think it is ridiculous to have 3 issues with a room during a single week. The bed was great - very comfortable, and the lanai was equally great. Bathroom was definitely 5-star. Beach Note, this resort is situated on a public beach. Not a swimming beach, at least at the time of the year we were there, but wonderful soft sand, and fun to jump into the waves...good for kids and adults. We rented a \"casabella\" for 4 of the days we were there and what a WASTE of money. True, you do get a guaranteed spot, and a nice view of the ocean, but of significant issue was the fact that about 2:30pm, we had non-paying \"visitors\" squatting in the adjacent casabellas. I raised this with the staff, and they explained that because they start removing the loungers and umbrellas at 3pm, this is a \"grey\" area and they don't really enforce the use of the casabellas for that reason from about 3pm onward. Well, there didn't seem to be any \"grey area\" with my $50/day bill for use of the casabellas! I think the resort should be pro-rating the charge for the \"free\" hours they are allowing non-paying patrons to use them. It really is absurd - so my advice, do not book a casabella...instead, wait until about 2:30pm and choose any free one and enjoy! Clearly the hotel has no problem with this. Food The food was excellent. Humu has an amazing filet mignon that is cooked to perfection. All the food was really quite good. Breakfast was quite good too - we ate at the buffet in the Grand Dining Room for breakfast. Like many similar places, you have to be prepared to wait a while to get a made-to-order omlette. The waiters at breakfast could also stand to get a refresher in good customer service...at least some of them. A couple of the waiters we had were great, others were terrible...no service at all. And, I personally saw one of the waiters go to the bathroom (beside the restaurant) and he didn't wash his hands. How disgusting is that? We had room service one evening and it was very good (albeit outrageously priced). Service Service was largely good...not great, but good. The wait staff at dinner was far better than breakfast or lunch. Despite the fact we paid $50/day for the casabellas, we only had a server approach us on 2 of the 4 days we rented the casabella. I thought the maid service was very good, and was impressed when I went to the room (on two occasions) while the maid was in the room, and she insisted I demonstrate it was my room by using the key card...this vs. my experience in Mexico where I strolled into the room when the maid was there and got a polite smile, despite I could have been anyone taking anything from the room. One other note is the cost of food / drinks during the day is really quite absurd. $13 for a cocktail (plus tip?). A hot dog will cost you $12 (each). I ordered some sushi and beers on the beach and rang up a $70 bill for a snack...gimme a break. Overall, a beautiful resort, on a beautiful beach. However, the $50/day casabella charge when others used it for free really iritated me. I wrote the hotel with the same complaint, and didn't hear back...I guess they don't care. So, my advice to all is feel free to use the casabellas, for free, from 2:30pm onward. And, if anyone asks, this is hotel practice and the \"grey area\". Would I go back? No.",

        "content": "My wife and I just returned from a 10-day stay at the Grand Wailea. Our very first impression as we drove in to the resort was that this was going to be a perfect honeymoon. The drive in to the resort is beautiful, especially at night with all of the Tiki torches lit. We were promptly greeted by the valet and escorted to the check-in desk and we were offered a free upgrade, as promised, but we were a bit disappointed that we were only offered a room with 2 double beds instead of a king - especially since the resort appeared to be extremely vacant. The room was as we expected, but it was not perfectly clean. The balconies looked as though they had not been washed in several months and the shower had mold along the grout lines where the grout met the glass. The landscaping of the resort was impeccable, but unfortunately that was not shared by the rest of the amenities. The common area hallways were not very clean and the upkeep was not spectacular. You don't need to look far to see areas that need improvement. Lot's of painting, cleaning, and repairs need to be made to get this hotel to what should be Waldorf-Astoria standards. One day I removed my plastic bracelet (Daily plastic bracelets must be worn to access the pool and beach areas) and placed it on a table near the elevator. Two days later when we checked out it was still there! This should give you some idea of the lack of attention to detail. I would guess that no less than 100 employees walked by that bracelet during those 2 days. The food at the Grand Wailea was spectacular, and overall the service was good. Our highlights include the service at the swim-up pool bar as provided by Wayne and Richard. Our waiter, Justin, at HumuHumu was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Some of the disappointments were the service at the breakfast restaurant, the Grand Dining Room. They must expect most customers to eat the Buffet so that they can serve theirselves, because the service was almost non-existent. We ate here three times and had hrrible service all three times. On our third visit, we decided to time how long it took before we were greeted by our server. It took 12 minutes, followed by another 9 minutes just to get coffee! We did complain to the hotel manager who put us in touch with the Food & Beverage Manager and the charges for two of the meals were reversed. Service by the adult pool was also very poor. We did see servers, but nobody ever stopped by to take our drink orders despite our attempts to wave their attention. We had to go inside the poolside restaurant to get our own drinks. The activities at the GW and in Maui are great. I am a certified diver, but my wife is not. She took a 45 minute course at the resort which consisted of a 20 minute lecture followed by a dive in their own dive pool. We were then both take to a beach dive right at the resort that had some reef and sea life. Our instructor/guide, Eric, was excellent. He was very friendly and we found sea turtles and a small octopus that we actually held in our hands while he took underwater photography. The concierge was also excellent. You MUST take advantage of the concierge. They will build you a whole itinerary for your visit and have relationships to book all of the non-resort activities on your behalf and have them billed to your room. We took a helicoptor tour of West Maui and Molokini with Sunshine helicoptors. They are the only provider that will guarantee front row seating for two for a small premium upgrade. The tour was good - not great, though that was no fault of the tour guide. It's just unfortunate that there are no active volcanoes to see in Maui. We also took a snorkel/snuba tour on a powered twin-hull catamaran out of Maalea Harbour. We dove at two locations Molokini Crater and another \"unknown\" location that was know to have lots of turtles. The crater was decent, but if you have any experience scuba diving, then this will not live up to your expectations. We happened to be out on a very windy and wavey day, so the snorkeling was difficult for most of the inexperienced snorkel, snuba divers (Snuba is a hybrid of snorkeling and scuba that allows you to breathe up to 20 feet underwater via a hose and air tank that floats on the surface). The highlight of this tour was having about 20 spinner dolphins swim with the boat as we cruised at slow speed between dives. The burgers that they cook right on board between dives were also pretty tasty! We did a zipline tour in Kaanapali that wes pretty good. Not as scarey as the ziplining in Costa Rica, but that's a good thing for most people. It seems much safer and has very large landing platforms so there is no fear of making any mistakes. In fact, they make it foolproof and the scenery is of course spectacular. The highlight of our activities was the drive to Hana. The drive is simply breathtaking through lush, tropical landscape along the most winding road you will ever travel! I recommend going on a day that has forecasted some rain or had rain the night before. The dozens of waterfalls that we saw along the way were extremely active due to all the rainfall they had up the mountain. Don't worry - it doesn't ever seem to rain in Wailea despite the forecast. Wailea gets 16\" of rain a year while it rains over 350\" just 10 miles away! It's the strangest thing - but very cool! The concierge will provide you a list of the best places to stop along the way to swim in waterholes and waterfalls, eat banana bread, buy local art, have a scenic lunch, etc. Do not miss out on this excursion! It takes a full day, but I found it far more exhilerating than the helicoptor tour. We drove back the same way we came up, though you can go all the way around the mountain. My wife had a videcamera but was afraid to let go of the dashboard because of my speeding down the roads! For driving enthusiasts that like to go fast, this is as good as it gets. By fast I mean a top speed of maybe 30 MPH. This road has over 600 turns where you turn the wheel greater than 45 degrees. I hope Playstation has this road on one of their driving games because I'm buying it! Other recommendations for food include Mama's Fish House for dinner. It's about a 30 minute drive from the resort, but it's very charming and the food is delicious. Everyone that you talk to will tell you to go here. We also had great meals at Duo and Spago next door at the Four Seasons. Overall, we had a wonderful trip. We had some disappointments with the resort that we did not expect to have when spending that kind of money. Plan to spend a lot of money! We averaged about $750 a day for 2 people, not including the cost of the room. The activities will run about $300 for ziplining to over $800 for the helicoptor tour. When you add that to $200+ dinners and lunch and drinks by the pool, you will see how it quickly adds up.",

Usually when we travel, we choose modest accomodations so we can splurge on activities and meals.

We were both rather disappointed that the quality wasn't better for the price. I've grilled better steak at home and the cocktails were less than impressive. Some people commented here that the spa was dirty. I completely disagree. I thought the spa was fantastic. Although the price tag was a bit steep, the baths were heavenly and the free scrub was an added bonus. I choose a traditional swedish massage, and my massage therapist, Roxanne, did an amazing job! It was quite an experience. If we were to go back to Maui, my husband and I would probably just stay at the Days Inn for $90 per night.",

But when it comes superior customer service, the Concierge at Napua Tower have been consistently exceptional. In particular, Jerry Fournier, the Napua Suite Liaison, has always helped us manage the vacation process before we arrive as well as coordinate plans during our stay. He's a go-to type of person that gets tasks done. Clearly it's a challenge keeping everyone happy simultaneously, but Jerry and his team just find a way to make it happen ! I do spend my fair share of time travelling for business, usually to Asia from the US's east coast multiple times a year. I am quite familiar with good service and few hotels in the US match up to their Asian counterparts. The Napua team is the closest I've seen to that type of service. For me to write something like this is rare indeed. But when someone like Jerry (and I'm sure there are more on the GWR staff) does his job everyday as an unsung hero of the resort, it merits special attention.",

We've been in Maui for about ten days for our honeymoon and have been staying at a few places including the Ritz Carlton, the Hotel Hana and the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea has been a HUGE disappointment. The service is lackluster at best and the entire place is packed with people. There is nothing relaxing about being here- it has the feel of an overpacked cruise ship. The grounds were supposed to be luxurious but are actually pretty tacky. There are ads everywhere for everything from vow renewals to property ownership and the whole place is just a tourist trap nightmare. My husband and I booked a spa treatment at the spa hoping that it would be a nice retreat but it was just more overpriced tourist fodder. The hydrotherapy room was so packed with people that it just seemed gross to be jumping in and out of the pools- you couldn't get any room to yourself. The service at the spa was not good, the whole place is much more hype than reality. At the end of the day we spent over $800 on spa treatments today and if I had to do it over again I wouldn't have done it. Moral of the story- this place is not at all worth it. We had heard that from some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and didn't listen and we couldn't regret it more. We made the mistake of pre-paying for our room and we were so disappointed when we arrived that we tried to cancel and go somewhere else but due to prepaying didn't have the flexibility to do so. If we could have left the day we checked in we absolutely would have.",

        "content": "Stayed at this hotel on a business conference but had a lot of time for personal fun. The Good: The facility is beautiful and the beach is beautiful. Everything is well kept and very nice. Room service did a great job every day. We didn't have kids with us so we spent a decent amount of time at the adult pool area. It's a nice pool with a big lawn you can hang out. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet. The beach is open to the public but not too many people outside the resort go there. You can swim in the water and the current is not bad at all. The staff seemed nice and we had good service from just about everyone. Valet parking for the day is free but you pay a lot to stay overnight. The Bad: As with everything in Hawaii the food and beverages at the hotel are very expensive. We bought a styrofoam cooler and some beer and wine at the Wal Mart and kept this in our room. We still ate and drank at the hotel but having our little cooler was a nice break from $10+ drinks. Overnight valet parking is very expensive so we parked in the free lot on the other side of the resort. It's first come first serve and fills up at night so get there early if you want a spot. There are some rooms that are newly renovated and others that are not. We were originally put in a newly renovated room but it had two beds. When they moved us to a room with one bed it was the older room. Bummer. It was nice but not as nice as the other. We didn't pay for our room (paid for by corporate) but when I compared the cost of this hotel vs. other comparable hotels it seemed a little pricey for what you get. I think this is because of the sweet beach location. We would consider returning in spite of this. Especially if we bring kids. The best part of our trip was renting a Harley for the day and cruising the island. Definitely one of the most memorable times of my life. Sorry if my review wasn't very thorough but we spent a lot of time either playing offsite or at organized social functions revolved around business. The functions were great and a lot of fun but it didn't give us a lot of time to really get a feel for everything at the resort.",

It was by far the best hotel on the island. The open-air lobby, friendly staff, and amazing views from the room, along with the most fun pool (all the pools are connected by water slides) and beach made our stay extremely memorable and fun. It's about 30 mintes from the airport - if you are renting a car, we STRONGLY recommend bringing a GPS to get around - it was incredibly useful to us. The room was spacious (we had a suite on the eighth floor) with three balconies. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom amenities - Honey Mango - are the best we've had!",

This is a very well maintained with a very attentive staff. The grounds are beautiful, if not a bit large. Unlike some other hotels in Wailea, this one is located right on the beach, with plenty of attendants to help set up beach chairs, umbrellas and the sort. The weekend I was there happened to be fairly quiet, so there were no issues finding a good spot on the beach, by the pool, etc. I can forsee how crowded the pools and beach can get during high season though. The restaurant choices were pretty good, albeit a little on the expensive side, but about on-par with what you'd expect from an upscale resort like this one. One thing I would like to spotlight is their Spa. This is probably one of the better spas I've been to, with a great staff, great treatment options, and excellent terme.",

        "content": "Went for freinds wedding and nearly chose to stay elsewhere due to cost but thankfully decided to stay 10 nights and would have regretted it if had gone elsewhere. The place is basically the \"Grandest\" hotel in probably the grandest resort (Wailea) on probably the best Hawian island. We went at the begining of Sept and it was only a thrid full which was great as busy but just nice, you could always get loungers, always got served quickly etc whereas we spoke to some people who had been there during the main weeks and they said it was bedlam and too busy so avoid then if possble. Hotel itself is huge with some grand rooms - the lobby and main bar area is impressive, with certain areas open to the elements and just oozes class. Rooms very spacious and very comfortable with flat screen tv's, mini bars and all other mod cons - bathroom was loved by my wife as has huge bath and at least a double sized walk in shower, 2 sinks etc etc etc. One of the main reasons we loved it so much was the pool areas; several pools starting at the top of the hill that have different slides (fast, twisty, straight leading into lazy river through ravine) that you just work your way through until you eventually come t the pool bar where \"you have to have a mudslide cocktail\" and then flow through the lazy river that takes you metres from the beachfront and then if you see fit back up to the top on a water elevator. For adults and bigger kids only who want fast slides, there are 2 big slides that go from top to bottom quickly that are great fun. Food at the hotel and neigbouring hotels (Fairmont & Four Seasons) plus \"The shops at Wailea\" is out of this world, good sized portions and sea food to die for (I think i ate the Pacifics stock of Scallops and Shrimp). The only downside is that this holiday aint a cheap one. The Grand Wailea dont seem to discount and only offer room only and the local restaurants as mentioned above costs best part of $200 per meal (2 adults and one child, starter, main and couple drinks) but i guess you get what you pay for. 10 mins drive away are cheaper restaurants and good supermarkets that you should definately use to stock up your water, drinks, snacks etc as they are probably only 25% of the price you pay at the hotel. Would i go there again - most definately and to be honest would kind of live with the cost if it was not for the 10 hour flight to the West Coast of America followed by a further 6 hours to Maui. Only regret - great golf courses just 5 mins away and didnt play !! Conclusion - pure class, treat yourself as a must do in a lifetime experience",

        "content": "We stayed at the Grand Wailea for 6 nights and stayed in an ocean view room in the Chapel Wing. The room overlooked the small chapel at the hotel where weddings take place. It is surrounded by a pond with giant fish that my kids loved to feed. We could also see some of the ocean. The gardens of the hotel are the highlight as they obviously spared no expense in landscaping the grounds. The hotel is a masterpiece. The open air lobby is magnificent and the fitness center is the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel. The problem is you pay a heavy price to stay here and I am not sure it is worth it. We booked our room through an opthalmology meeting that was there in order to get a meeting rate. We still paid 400 dollars a night, plus multiple fees were added on including an 18 dollar a day \"resort fee\" supposedly to cover our access to the swimming pools and fitness center. The food and drink prices are prohibitively expensive. They charged my children 8 dollars each for a frozen lemonade at the pool restaurant. A minimal lunch for 3 was over 70 dollars (at the pool). We ended up eating every meal at restaurants in Kihei. They even charged us 25 dollars to rent a small fridge for the week as the rooms have a fridge, but it is full of high priced snacks and drinks and is locked unless you opt for the \"self service bar\" option. The rooms were nice, but not exceptional for the price. The swimming pools were so cold that it was unpleasant to swim in them. There were no organized pool activities and no drink service at the pools. The beach was great and well maintained. The staff was pleasant but not overly friendly. The nicest person I met there was the maid for our room. They did respond quickly when or toilet clogged. The whole place had an air of pretentiousness about it. I think the only people who can afford it are foreigners who's currency is strong against the dollar. I struggled daily to find a parking place big enough for my rented minivan in the under sized self park garage that was quite a hike to my room. The garage by the front of the hotel is valet parking only. When I return to Maui I will stay somewhere more reasonable as the main attraction to the Grand Wailea is the many pools and its location. I think there are other hotels that would offer the same for less.",

        "content": "I have been coming to Wailea since 1993 and have always wanted to stay at the Grand Wailea. This year my conference had it's meetings at the hotel. Usually I have always stayed at the now defunct Renaissance Hotel 2 hotels north. For all the hype I've heard and the prices, I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately I was underwowed. I am a Diamond member within the Hilton Hotel system and the front desk notified me that I was upgraded to a deluxe ocean view for which I am grateful. When I asked where self parking was, they told me \"a quarter mile down the road\". This wasn't as bad as it sounded as you can walk most of it through the hotel. The bad part is there is very little parking and the spaces are sized for Mini Coopers. I was glad I turned down the upgrade to a Cadillac as I would never have parked. Vallet parking is $20/night. I arrived to my room on the 7th floor of the Wailea wing at the distal third of the wing. Nice view of the ocean and quiet until last night when a noisy family arrived above me at midnight. The room was spacious and has a nice marble bathroom and tub. 2 robes are provided, but no slippers. I've never been to a Hilton here in the states or around the world that didn't have slippers. When I called housekeeping they said slippers \"were only for VIPs\", but they brought me some anyway. Being a diamond member (which is the highest level of Hilton's frequent guest program) apparently didn't count. The Waldorf-Astoria collection is part of the Hilton Family. The coffee in the room and at the Grand Dining room is truly awful. The second worst coffee I've ever had after a Holiday Inn in Souzhou, China. My next problem was the internet connection. I spent about 3 hours with Lodgenet (the hotel's internet support in Atlanta, GA) and 2 of the engineering employees here at the hotel. Finally, we took my computer to the next room that worked perfectly and the engineer took that modem and placed it in my room and I finally had service. The engineer here at the hotel didn't seem to understand computers very well, and the support staff at Lodgenet couldn't figure out the issue. The breakfast buffet came with my room and the setting is beautiful overlooking the grounds and ocean. A egg bar is there for personalized eggs of any sort. There is a Japanese bar with miso soup, rice and condiments. Hot foods with sablefish alternating without another fish which are both overcooked and dry. Sliced potatoes alternating with hash browns, Bacon, and a meat hash. There is also waffles, fruit selections, salad ingredients and some really good smoked salmon daily. Breads are massed produced and taste like it. The buffet is $28/person.The day I arrived the major pools were shut down for renovation and only the Hibiscus Pool is currently open. There are 2 jacuzzis with this open until 10PM. The beach is one of the best on Maui. Unfortunately, being at the front of the property from the pool down to the beach is also the area that you can hear the generators for the workers. They are there everyday during all daylight hours. If you want to enjoy the beach and not hear construction noise you can walk to the Fairmont further south (the Four Seasons next store shares the same beach and has the same noise pollution). Otherwise, you can go north to the beach that was in front of the Renaissance. This is pretty deserted because the hotel is now closed. The staff is friendly and the housekeeping staff is cleaning my rooms well. As the previous reviewer noted, I also haven't received bar soap since my last one was used. The scented Mango/coconut lotion/shampoo etc smells good, but the shampoo made my hair feel \"rough\" and not clean. Overall, I am enjoying my stay after getting around all the hiccups, but to me the physical plant is similar to what the Renaissance was, not anything better. I checked out the Marriott next store and was disappointed. They had sold the Renaissance and moved here, but the rooms, amenities, quality is not at the level the Renaissance was. The Grand Spa they say is rated the best spa in the US by Conde Nast. Once again I was expecting to be wowed, and wasn't. It is very similar to the California Burke William Spas, but more expensive of course. The terme room is a nice concept, but when you think about 5 or 6 bathtubs with different solutions (like mud, seaweed etc) into which multiple people get in and out of after soaking for any length of time, it's like sharing your bathtub at home with multiple people you don't know.",

        "content": "The exterior or the grounds of Grand Wailea is beautiful! The moment you drive up you feel that you have arrived in paradise as you watch their mini waterfall. The hotel has all the amenities you need, just a walk to the pools, beach, nearby hotel restaurants, spa, & water activities. With all these positives the negative would be the price and the room. I think the price you pay should be relative to what you get. The hotel is overrated. It seems like they put all the money, near $500 a night they charge the customers with the upkeep of the exterior of the hotel and fell short with the actual rooms. We were assigned a room that was a bit of a walk to the beach and pool area. Our room's view was facing the self parking. If you are a very light sleeper like I am, try not to get a room assigned on this side. In the morning you can kind of hear the trucks making their deliveries around 6am! The room itself, looks outdated. It is not terrible, its just descent. We expected more for the price. The hotel should put the money renovating their rooms. In regards to food, the only time we ate at the hotel was for breakfast from the cafe. The food lacked flavor. I ordered a waffle and my husband ordered a breakfast platter. It consists of eggs, sausage, bread roll, and a cup of rice. We didn't even order any drinks and we paid about $38. Again, the price is definitely NOT relative to the overall stay. My suggestion is to book a room at a nearby hotel and walk over to Grand Wailea to take pictures.",

Didnt see the problems others claim and were at the resort at almost the same time. As a Diamond VIP, we were upgraded to the 9th (top floor) with a full ocean view...was a great view, the staff were very nice, place was very clean...grounds were well kept. Like any other resort, food and drink are pricey but unlike other resorts you get free parking, free internet, no daily resort fee which can be anywhere from 10-25 dollars per day. I normally wouldn't say that I would like to return to a particular place just cause we like to explore others but will return to this resort as one to go to in Maui. We stayed at the Hilton last year in Hawaii...nice but way too big and hard to get around...these grounds were laid out nicely, short walk to pools and beach, nice water front paths for daily walks..just a great place to relax... like any other place, there is a costco nearby so loading up on drinks and snacks is worth it... if your booked don't let the bad reviews get you down...you will be happy with your stay...enjoy!",

        "content": "The Grand Wailea is an unbelievable resort! On this trip it was only my wife and I. Next time i will bring my two children. I have never stayed in a resort as completely overwhelming in class as The Grand. Do know that it would be really tough to stay here on a budget. Everything, especially the food, is pricey. We checked in on Sunday, July 20th, and took advantage of the Sunday Brunch. It was $48 per person. It was amazing. The next day we ate Sushi at Kincha's. Two buffets and an additional Rainbow Roll, plus a tea and glass of wine and we walked out the door for $160. The sushi, even for a buffet, was as good as I have ever had. For lunch another day we ate at the pool and for two wraps, two bottle waters, one smoothie, a mixed drink, plus tip and we signed a ticket for $70. In case you are wondering, all of the food and drinks are tops, but you get what you pay for. The view from my 8th floor room was breathtaking of the grounds and ocean. My advice is to request a room on an upper floor. I have included pictures of the room and restroom and our view. The beds, pillows, and linens are very satisfying. There are no rooms in any of the buildings that don't face the ocean, but the lower the floor the more trees to look over. The Spa Grande is well worth every penny. For a 2:00 appointment they have you arrive at 1:00 to take advantage of all the other amenities that you have available. There are different baths, whirlpools, etc that are intended to help you relax before your massage or other. The service is very impressive. The pool is tremendous. If you are thinking if your children would be entertained at the Grand, you need to know the pool is like a miniature water park. There are slides, one as long as 180 feet, a rapids slide, a water elevator, zero entry for the little ones, and a volleyball net in the larger pool. Thre is a lazy river but bring you own floatation devices because they are not provided. Some comments about the pool being crowded made me fear not getting a chair. There was never a problem when my wife and I were ready to find a place. Reference my pictures for some views of the pools. By design the hotel's rooms are a comfortable distance from the pools. Upon my check in, while looking toward the back, you can't see the pools. It isn't too far, just hidden a bit. I will be going back to The Grand Wailea. I stayed three nights at a condo prior to my checking in to The Grand and the difference in overall experience was like winning the lottery. As a whole, my experience in the area stores and shops was not the friendliest experiences. I would say most tourist places employees get tired of people. The Grandâ€™s employees are there to serve you. The only inconvenience in staying here is that you have to go down to the 4th floor, walk across the lobby area to get to another elevator to get from the 4th floor down. Not a huge deal, but a little time consuming. I am posting pictures so you can see some areas of the property.",

The wheels of the housekeeping carts rumble loudly early in the AM on the tile floors. The food is ultra expensive (even for HI standards) and run of the mill. Feels like a Vegas hotel (one in need of a few million $ in upgrades) planted in a pristine spot. We were there for an awards trip and the lobby bar closed before 12 each night. When it was open, we found the informative and friendly help there the highlight of the stay. Other staff couldn't be bothered, for the most part. Upon arrival after a terrible delay en route the bellman asked \"do you really need help with your bags?\" Would never pay to stay there when the outstanding Four Seasons is just up the road - a bit higher in rates for Ocean view rooms.",

        "content": "After looking forward to a week of sheer luxury, the Grand Wailea was a massive disappointment. Things did not get off to a good start when we arrived tired and jet lagged at 12 noon off a flight from Japan and asked whether we could check in earlier than the normal 3pm time. The front desk said that they would contact housekeeping to get our room ready early and took our mobile phone number, so they could tell us when the room was ready. Two hours passed with no contact, so we went back to the front desk. They assured us that the room was being given the express treatment. Three o'clock came and went, and at around 3:15pm we were taken by a bell hop to a filthy room which hadn't been touched. The bell hop rang down to the front, who said that they had given us the wrong room. Eventually, we were placed in the right room and the bell hop fled from embarrassment without explaining any of the room's facilities and without hanging around for a tip (the one and only time at our stay in the resort). My sense from was that housekeeping had no intention of getting a room ready before 3pm and we were just fobbed off by the front desk. After unpacking, we headed down to the pool. The place was packed. Not a free chair in sight. When we turned up poolside the next day around 10am, the same situation. This is where I part company with all those four and five star reviews for this same hotel I have read. In a true luxury hotel, you do not have to fight for a pool side seat, you do not have to rush down to the pool at the crack of dawn to place your towel on a seat, you do not have to pay $100 a day to reserve a bit of shade. This is not what a luxury hotel does. This is what a mass market, mid-level or worse hotel does. Indeed, the hotel seemed intent on gouging clients at every turn. From internet access, to umbrellas on the beach, to the daily resort charge (what is this? surely when you book a room at the price of this hotel, you assume that you will be using the resort facilities). Finally, the food was truly terrible value for money. We tried the Bistro Molokini, Grand Dining Room, Cafe Kula and the Japanese restaurant Kincha. In every case you got second rate food for around two to four times the price you would pay in a good city restaurant. Everything appeared to be out a tin, instant mix or the freezer. Given everything has to be shipped into Maui, I can see the limitations. But true luxury hotels that have island locations around the world like the Four Seasons work around this - that is why you pay big bucks: so as to get good, well cooked fresh food. At the Grand Wailea you pay big bucks to get tarted-up school canteen slop. Finally, I got caught up in the airline bankrupcty problems during my stay and had to switch my flight out to Hawaiin Airlines from Aloha. Stupidly, I thought that I could use the Grand Wailea's clout to help navigate my way through all the ticketing chaos rather than waste a whole day on the phone and internet. Of course, they were not interested in helping (even up to the Day Manager level). Again the contrast with a real luxury hotel is telling: in such hotels, the senior people at the front desk have a degree of autonomy and flexiblity in problem solving for clients. At the Grand Wailea, if it is not in their rule book, they are not interested. In conclusion, for all those people who have rated this hotel highly (and for the senior management of the Grand Wailea who don't appear to get it), all I can say is try a true luxury hotel. It costs the same you know. The experience you will have at the Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons and Shangri-la is at a completely different level. Amazingly, the Waldorf Astoria has lent its brand to the Grand Wailea. I don't know what they are thinking. This is a classic way to damage a luxury brand. It fooled me into booking this hotel once, but not again! And now I will also think twice about booking any Waldorf Astoria worldwide.",

        "content": "Well, having read about how the Grand Wailea needed renovations; about how everything costs so much and nickel and diming; having read about no HHonors privileges, and kids running rampant, I had set pretty low expectations about this trip. Fortunately, my experience was the opposite of all those negative reviews! We booked 6 nights for 300,000 HHonors points, and paid $500/night for two additional nights. I expected no upgrade, but we were upgraded to Napua Tower; I expected no HHonors \"perks\" but was immediately recognized as a Diamond member, given $25 certificate for use at Molokini Bistro, and 20% discount certificate for the spa - as well, as a welcoming letter from the manager (which said, by the way \"If you're Diamond or Gold, and we haven't been able to give you a free upgrade, you will be given other options and additional HHonors points.\" I expected moldy carpets and furniture, peeling wallpaper, and dirty tile grout in the bathroom, but got a beautifully furnished, exceptionally maintained, spacious ocean-view room - my wife was especially happy that we could sit on the lanai and see Molokini, and watch whales. I expected to be charged extra for taking a deep breath, but, really found nothing out of line with any other top-line resort. Yeah, $18 for a burger is on the high side, but, look where you get to eat it! Maybe it was just the time of our visit, but, while we saw lots of kids, they certainly were neither pervasive, nor pests. We loved the idea that there was an adult pool - with lounges available as late as 9:30 in the morning (we were never unable to find a pair near the pool) and kids were over in there's doing whatever they wanted to do. Seems Hibiscus was heated, and activity pools were not, but they were certainly not uncomfortable - and at least as warm as the ocean! The staff was friendly and helpful, the facility was beautiful and comfortable. Loved the Hospitality Suite for shower and changing clothes on last day - we checked out of our room at 2:00 PM and stayed by the pool until 5:00 PM - and easily caught our 9:40 PM flight home. And, for those who think Wailea is too haughty, I believe you've got it wrong. Wailea is maintained and manicured, for sure, but the people and the facilities are as friendly and outgoing there as anywhere on the island. And, they tolerate rednecks like me!",

The garden inside the hotel is just stunning. The hotel is also big, very big. It can be good or bad depending on peopleâ€™s taste. But we find it very interesting because there is a lot to explore. The room we had was a deluxe ocean view room. It is very clean and has all the amenities you can think of. We have nothing to complain about the staff.

        "content": "This Resort was totally Posh! I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a $@!#%, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures. I have a ton of them.",

        "content": "We were quite amazed by the palatial-ness of this hotel. The room was beautiful, and the hotel itself very grand-- full of statues, flowers, fountains, beautiful sitting areas -- and then you get to the water park. Oh my goodness. They have GREAT waterslides, a water volcano, waterfalls, a pool-river that you can float along WITH rapids, a rope swing, and more. They even have a \"water elevator\" (which we did not try). We were there during the summer, so all of these attractions were quite packed with children (especially the water rapids slide, which was like a bowling alley of 9 year olds)-- but we 30-somethings managed to squeeze in and partake... It was fun! They also have one adult-only pool (which has a lot of adults lounging in it with Mai Tais)... so that one was pleasantly low-key... One thing I would say as a problem is the premium you have to pay for shade on the pool deck ($150 for the minimum two-chair accordion umbrella coverage, and goodness knows how much for a cabana). The sun is very hot and strong-- or at least it was when we were there in August. Down in the children's area, there are a few free thatch umbrellas (though people seemed to take the chairs under those quite early in the morning), but it's noisy down there-- not a super relaxing place to sit if you're a couple without kids. On the beach area you can rent an umbrella-- not sure how much that is, but I just think, if you are paying that much for a room, they shouldn't be so stingy with the shade. We have stayed at less expensive beach hotels elsewhere in the world (Mexico, Bermuda) where beach umbrellas were part of the deal... Anyway, we just stayed here one night, as we wanted to move around Maui and spend our days out touring and snorkeling, etc (if we are paying that much for a hotel, we didn't want to be out doing activities all day). One day/night was good to experience the \"oh WOW\" factor, but of course, two nights or more will be more relaxing... All depends on your budget!",

        "content": "Just returned from Maui where we planned to spend 10 days at the Grand Wailea. The setting is beautiful but the rooms, the staff, the cleanliness and the service left us wondering what we were paying so much money for. Our room suffered from deferred maintenance; the bedding was not clean; the mattress was broken down on one side; the tile in the bathroom was stained and often not cleaned well by housekeeping; the shower head leaked more water from the valve than it sprayed. When asked to leave extra towels, housekeeping simply took the tip and moved the note to the nightstand, ignoring the request entirely. We reserved and paid $275.00 in advance for a cabana at the pool and had to spend the entire day policing the chairs that were included with the cabana because the hotel does not provide different towels to indicate that those are reserved chairs. When we asked for a different cabana location after our third day in the same one (we wanted a change of scenery), we were told that we could have that same cabana or none. The food was mediocre at best, and very expensive, although the wait staff at every place we ate was friendly and helpful. On the fourth day we sought the assistance of a manager for the smelly bedding and inability to get enough towels for each of us to have just one. The solution was to remove the feather bed and down comforter and leave us with a lightweight blanket and cheap mattress pad. The attitude was \"if you don't like it we can make it worse for you.\" Our bill was in excess of $1200. per day with the standard room in the lagoon wing, cabana and food we charged to the room-not worth it for that kind of attitude! We checked out on the fifth day and moved to The Four Seasons where we had exquisite service, food and our room was clean and free of deferred maintenance. Our bill was much lower and our vacation was revived.",

        "content": "We just completed another stay at the GWR in late may early June and we had a great time. What the Grand Wailea is: Very expensive, cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with Four Seasons, Ritz and JW's in service; mediocre in food and has the audacity to charge handsomely for shade at the pool. Why do we keep coming back? The resort itself is amazing. The pools are the highlight, the beach is one of the best anywhere, the offshore reef is an easy swim to see the sea turtles, and the artwork and gardens make you feel like you've found paradise. We were guests in 1991 when the resort opened and again shortly after the hotel was award 5 Diamonds so we are dissapointed that the hotel has becom indifferent to all the small things that differentiate a good resort from a great one. But let's face it, this place is fun, beautiful and if you are a business person who spends significant time away from the family, the GWR allows you to have fun together as a family and reconnect. To maximize your enjoyment of the resort you need to go in understanding that you won't have the personal service of the 4S, yes a drink will cost $13 at the pool and this is an activity based resort, lot's of kids and adults who are acting like kids. If you want quiet this is not the place for you. My last advice is eat offsite when you can. We had great meals at Joe's at the Wailea tennis club go at sunset and order the pumpkin seed coated Mahi. If you're in the mood for a steak, Ruth Chris is next door. We had a poor experience at Nick's at the Fairmont (dry Mahi and a very stingy poor of Sonoma Cutrer for $15).",

The only somewhat negative factor is that the hotel is located somewhat far from the main cities/areas of Maui. There are no waves on Wailea beach so we had to go to Lahaina for surfing and that was about 45 minutes away. We stayed in the Napua tower and enjoyed the morning breakfast and afternoon appetizers and cocktails. I also went to the spa and it was amazing. I have been to many spas but none quite as pampering as the Grand. My husband said he enjoyed the gym and that is was large for a hotel gym. We did not have any problems getting chairs on the beach or by the pool as others have mentioned. I guess we went not on a peak time for Hawaii.",

        "content": "After a long business trip to Phoenix we (my son and I) decided to take a quick weekend vacation from Honolulu at the Grand Wailea in Maui. As soon as our taxi from the airport arrived at the hotel the bellhop happly opened the door and gave us leis and offered to take our bags, aftering accepting there offer they directed us to the check in desk. The line was rather long but it went rather quickly. After receiving our room keys the same bellhop that assisted us upon arrival showed us to our rooms and asked if there was anything else we needed. After he left we toured our room which was actually very nice, but deffinatlly not worth the $700 price tag. The bathroom was very nice and very clean, but in other parts of the room there were defiant signs of aging as you could see wood chips missing from the closet door and from the bathroom door. But overall the only thing that really I disliked was the fact that there was a stain on one of our pillows that looked of blood. Emidiately we called house keeping who showed up very shortly (withing 10 minutes) and genuanly apologised for the inconvenience. After looking at our room we toured the property and decided to try and go for a swim aftering getting into our swimsuits and going down to the pool it was shocking to find out that towels were not being given out beyond six even though the pool was open till 10:00. So we went back up to the room ordered room service and ended the day. On our first day we went to the pool at about 10 AM and found the pools to be absolutley amazing, but at the same time very crowded with other familys. The adult pool though was like walking into another world it was very quite and had attentative service. One thing we were very happy about though was that there were pool chairs avaliable, becaue after reading the horror stories of having to come out at six in the morning to get a chair we began to worry. Later on that evening me and my son decided to go to the spa for the evening and both agreed that it was above and beyond what we had expected. On our last day at the Grand Wailea we came out to the pool at noon and to our amazment the horror stories were true no chairs were avaliable, but and excellent pool staff member gladly helped up out by finding us two chairs. She even offered to get our pool towels and wrist bands for us as an apology, but we declained not wanting to be a burdan. Overall our stay at the Grand Walea was very good, not worth $700 a night but still very good.",

If you look at the pictures on their website, you can see that the property is very luxurious and opulent. The photos don't do it justice! It is truly like staying in paradise. There's something for everyone there...of all ages. You could stay at the Grand for an entire week and never leave the hotel and have a tremendous time! What really struck me, however, was the \"ohana' (family) spirit there...although the setting is so elegant, you can feel very relaxed in the most casual clothing and not have to feel like you're \"keeping up with the Jones's\" The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home, even though the place is so large. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! The only downside perhaps, is the high price. What we've done sometimes is split our stay between this and another more reasonably priced hotel to make the vacation more affordable. Mahalo, Grand Wailea!",

        "content": "We've been to Maui 11 times, staying for at least a week each time, and finally succumbed to the hype about the Grand Wailea (GW) and decided to stay there over Thanksgiving. We've typically rented one of the 2/3 BR Villas over at the Kea Lani, but decided to get two adjoining deluxe oceanfront rooms. The \"membership\" is mostly a rip-off. We did get our \"discount\" but this is calculated from the HIGHEST published rates, and was hardly a bargain. The nickel and dime fees were maddening: There is the resort fee $20, Valet fee, $15, Adjoining Room Fee $20 ea. as well as the usual excise fees. So this added up to about $100/night more than the \"discounted rate\" for each of the rooms ($1800 over our entire stay) With Maui, the prices are always high...but at the GW, they are outrageous, and the quality of the food was just not good at Bistro Molokini or the Volcano Bar. $25 for a cold, undercooked burger, a bag of Maui chips and a warm beer served by the horribly overworked pool wait staff was typical. We routinely went over to the 4 Seasons next door for breakfast because the food and service were excellent, and the prices were cheaper. The Kula Cafe had great food and the prices were sane The location was great, and we had excellent dinners at Ruths, Spago, Ferraros, Tommy Bahama Cafe, and Fire Dragon (mediocre) as well a few others farther away. Service ranged from disdainful/indifferent to excellent, depending on the situation. The attitude is pretty much one of \"if you don't like this place, go away....there are 10 more in line\", but there were a few people that were really nice and provided excellent service. The whole place was understaffed. At check in, it took us 45 minutes of standing in line, waiting on only 3 clerks. The whole place was dated, and worn out. Cracking stone, in the common areas, flagstone falling off, tile coming off the bond beams on the pools, etc. The hotel has obviously been really popular and looks like the hotels right around large convention centers that get enormous trade show traffic. The water features are cool, but the kids hated the line for the water elevator and ditched that after the first 2 or 3 times. The slides are long, and for safety's sake, the guards wait until the riders have cleared the bottom before sending the next rider. Unfortunately, this really makes the cycle time long and the lines are huge. My kids were sick of the waterslides after a day or two. I did get a charge out of the gamesmanship necessary to get coveted poolside chairs. If you aren't waiting in line by 6:45 and ready to get personal belongings onto the chairs as soon as you walk down, you are toast. There is an attendant walking around photographing \"unattended\" chairs to try to cut down on the \"land grabs\" but it is a tough job. In the summer, it must be completely nuts. My wife said that the Spa was terrific We went \"for the kids\" but they gave the GW \"three thumbs down\"",

        "content": "Grand Wailea - 10/03/06-10/10/06 We just got back from our honeymoon at the Grand Wailea in Maui. All I can really say about the hotel is it was average. Staff: Very friendly Grounds: very nice, but a bit too big for a honeymoon couple wanting a little romance. I could see how it would be good for a family with kids. The grounds are very pretty, but we did see a dead koi fish in one of the ponds and a large roach walking around. Restaurants: The Humuhumu... restaurant was expensive, but was not very good. The Kincha Japanese buffet (fri. & mon. - $50 ) was very good. The mini-burgers that can be ordered from the Botero bar were delicious, but kinda pricey at $20. Room service was served quickly, but the food was just average. Housekeeping: The rooms were kept very clean. When we returned from our daily excursions, the rooms were always cleaned and new amenities were provided. We did however find one roach in our room and we were occasionally visited by a few ants. Recommendations if staying at the Grand Wailea: Go to the ABC store located next door at the Shops at Wailea, to puchase essentials (water, soda, snacks, etc.), it'll save you A LOT of money. If you like sea food, you must try Mama's Fish House, located in Paia (about 30 min. drive from hotel). Confirm that there is no construction/renovation being done to the rooms surrounding your room.

        "content": "I've been to Maui a few times and usually stay at the Fairmont in Wailea. A few weeks ago, we decided to try the Grand Wailea since we heard it was the best hotel on the island. From the outside, the hotel looked very promising. The exterior was beautiful, the pools spectacular, and the beach access unbeatable. But from the moment we pulled up to the valet, we realized that the hotel was simply a body without a soul. As we pulled up, we had to wait a minute or so before we were \"greeted\" by a valet. In fact, we had already unloaded our bags before one of the valets finally showed up. As we walked into the lobby, the female greeter uninterestedly placed leis (sp ?) around our necks. She didnt even bother smiling. I contrast this with the warmth and friendliness that greeted us everytime we arrived at the Fairmont. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 3:30pm, which is about half an hour past the official check in time. However, our room was still not available and we were asked to simply wander about the hotel and were told that we would get a call on our cell phone when our room was ready. Half an hour later we still had not received a call and decided to go back to the front desk. After waiting a somewhat lengthy time to finally speak to a front desk person, we were told that our room was ready. Where was that phone call? When we got to our room, we were fairly unimpressed. The bathroom looked dated and the overall size was smaller than the rooms at the Fairmont. The pool area is truly the gem of this hotel. There are something like 10 pools and various slides and water attractions. However, if you're an adult, you might find the number of screaming kids a bit overwhelming. The hotel had a feel comparable to your average waterpark. Nevertheless, my friends and I still enjoyed the pool. The easy beach access was also a positive as it was just a few steps from the pool area. My biggest complaint about the hotel is the service, or lack thereof. There was none of the island love, or general hospitality that you would expect from a 5 star resort, or more importantly a hotel that costs 500-900 bucks a night. The staff members rarely smiled, they seemed bothered when you approach them with a question, and generally seem out of place at a high-end resort. None of the little touches were found at the Grand Wailea. For example, at the Fairmont, smiling pool side employees would frequently walk around handing out fresh pineapples. At the Marriott Ihilani in Oahu, they had a jolly guy walking around the pool spritzing cool water on the feet of hotel guests. Those little things are so important when you pay the kind of rates you pay at the Grand Wailea. The capper to our 5 day stay was the jack hammering that started at 7:30AM during the last 2 days of our stay. Imagine if you will, waking up in paradise to loud jack hammering...at 7:30 in the freaking morning. When we complained during the last day, they told us that they had left letters in our rooms telling us of the jackhammering. First, we didnt get a letter. Second, who cares if you they left a letter? Why not wait until a more reasonable time to start causing that kind of noise. Fortunately they decided to comp us one night which made the experience slightly more bearable. My last memory of the Grand Wailea was back in the valet. After the valet pulled up the car for the final time, he sat there and watched as my friends and I struggled to place the bags in our trunk. No offer to help. Needless to stay, I will never again stay at this hotel. I've warned my friends who are planning trips to Hawaii to stay away from this place. If this was a normal 200 dollar a night hotel, I really wouldnt have cared. But paying Grand Wailea rates for Motel 6 service is just unacceptable.",

        "content": "I am looking at the ocean in my Grand Wailea ocean view right now. The room is good, quite spacious and I CAN see the ocean from my 6th floor room (I guess we got lucky). Hotel grounds are lovely and extensive with loads of Koi ponds and waterfalls. It's peak season so the pools are filled with kids but the beach isn't crowded and it's easier to get a chair. I'd recommend the room + Breakfast package as the buffet is fine and it'll probably cost you more to eat a la carte. The staff are friendly but I wouldn't say that they go the extra mile considering the hotel rating and room prices. I have had better at Ritz Carlton, Westin and other 5* hotels. I'll agree that they do Nickel and Dime you, although you wish it were just Nickels and Dimes. The hotel is expensive, to eat, sleep and play will cost you a pretty penny! But I've looked at some of the other hotels (including the Four Seasons next door) and this one may just have one of the best overall packages for pools, gardens, beach, eating and accommodation. It's probably especially good for families as the kids will swim all day. That said I couldn't give it top marks because for the high cost there are no hammocks between palms (come on this is Hawaii it's what you'd expect), the staff could do better, everything closses at 9:30 and the overall finish isn't the best, so the Wow factor is low. To end there was a bit of a fiasco at checkin with room availability that many people seemed to be suffering from, we had to stay in a garden view room for the first night (they comped it though and gave us a drink at the bar!!). The reason for the problems are that Hilton have bought the hotel and decided to change booking systems mid peak season that has caused a few headaches, we were patient though and were rewarded for it.",

        "content": "I just returned from a week at the grand wailea, and can honestly say it was one of the finest resorts I have ever visited. Yes, there are some minor flaws, but nothing I experienced merited some of the lambasting reviews posted here, which made me quite nervous, as I had booked the hotel months ago. First off: the rooms are normal. They do not measure up to the standard of the JW Marriott on Oahu, but did not seem inadequate either. Luckily, we were upgraded to the Wailea suite, a large two-bedroom room with a full refrigerator and table. It is worth requesting an upgrade, I can tell you that. The parlor made it hard to leave in the morning. The grounds are filled with tropical gardens which are sprinkled with great works of art, and the grounds don't seem tacky, but like a true tropical paradise, which is lucky because you will be doing a lot of walking. I got lost several times on the first day. The pool is incredible: it consists of several pools linked by tile slides, emptying into a main activity pool, which is rarely crowded. There is a separate adult pool: during my stay, it never had more than 10 people in it. The poolside dining is varied and tasty. There is little shade here, which makes renting a cabana useful, but at $200, it is a bit of a ripoff, even though they do deliver fruit, water, towels, cold towels, frozen grapes, and icepops throughout the day. The pool staff is a bit unprofessional, something not relfected throughout the rest of the resort. Nevertheless, the activity pool (the one with the slides) never felt like a waterpark, but instead like a particularly nice complement to Wailea Beach, the best beach I have ever visited. It has everything: nice sand, equipment rentals, crystal clear water, and even snorkeling in the morning. I recommend going out early just beyond the rocks at the neighboring Four Seasons to see a cornucopia of aquatic biodiversity. One woman spotted a green sea turtle. The beach has waves, which invariably heightened during the afternoon, making for some entertaining waveriding. After an enjoyable day, it would be nice to have a good hotel dinner to look forward to, but the restaurants here fall short, for the most part, of the resort's opulence. Kincha, the japanese restaurant, is the best at the place. HumuHumu was well overpriced, and mediocre. Finally, Bistro Molokini was good for lunch, but had a limited and expensive menu. Most things here are overpriced, even for hawaii, which is my only fault with the place. Room service is always expensive, I know, but a $6 can of soda, an $11 bagel, and the breakfast buffet for $27 (limited selection) all seemed disgustingly overpriced. Wailea in general seems this way. I would recommend a trip to Spago, at the four seasons, for great service and even better food. The golf is also spectacular, and their private lessons are very helpful. For families, or even active adults, the Grand Wiailea seems like the best choice on maui. It is palatial, and grand in every sense of the word. Bottom line, is that the four seasons looked nice, but if the kids in my party ever wandered over the the Wailea activity pool, they would be very jealous. My one regret is not venturing into Lahaina, where the restaurant selection seemed more diverse than on the south side of the island.",

        "content": "We spent one week of our three week Hawaii trip at the Grand Wailea. We did not read the reviews before we went because we received the trip as an incentive package from one of the vendors from our heating & air conditioning business on the east coast of US. In response to reviews we read after returing home to write a review I offer the following: We though the place was fantastic. The grounds in our opinion were beautiful. Our oceanview room was spacious with standard ammenties that we would expect at this level of resort. Large soaking tub and seperate shower for two, seperate toilet room, sitting area in room, desk with high speed internet, lani with seating. The room was comfortable, bedding was fine, no noise from outside. Maid service was fine. The pool area was busy, I did not want a cabana but if I would have I would has planned in advance. We travel alot, usally in 4 star plus accommadations, in doesn't make any difference how much you pay there are allways people that don't know how to conduct themselves. Every time we went to the pool there were no \"open\" chairs. This day and age even with the hotel claiming they watch for unused but \"saved\" chairs you have to take matters into your own hands. If there were just towels, not personal items, we pitched them in the used towel bin and replaced them with clean ones. Big deal, if some one presented themselves stating that the chairs were theirs and we had been there the hotels limit of one hour we would tell them that the hotel cleared their towels, go speak to someone with the hotel as we are using the chairs and are not leaving. No one ever presented themselves. Many reviews stated about things being run down, yes our room could have been touched up where people knocked their luggage in to the wall, but who cares about a few of the million plus pool tiles being broken. The hotel was hosting a group of 750 from Sprint also when we were there (4/23 to 4/29). Someone claimed they over booked and paid them to move to another hotel but allowed them to use the facilities. They put some Sprint folks up next door at the Four Seasons. Some of the people from other hotels using the Grand's pool were authorized but I am sure there were some ousiders also. The hotel actually gives a wrist band to help keep unauotherized folks out, good luck pool police ! Yes everything is expensive at the Grand, and in Hawaii in general. One person complained that the resturants were so expensive that they were eating PBJ sandwich's to get by. What did they expect? They should do a little more research befor they book next time. We ate at the fancy \"HunHun\", of something like that, one night, expensive yes, food was excellent, service was okay, waitress had zero personality, never did return to see if everything was okay. We have had better service in a $5.00 a plate diner, or a $100.00 a plate fine dinning place, but we have also had the worst service possible in both of these extremes. You could blame the hotel for employing them but, when you look a the housing and wage difference in Hawaii It's a wonder to me that they can have enough people to serve us travelers who invade their homeland and expect everyone to bow to them because we have enough money to get there! I think the Grand is Great and if anyone knows were you can do better for less let me know!",

We could see the ocean and gardens from our balcony!!The room was generally guiet - some construction noise from accross the street but this wasn't all the time. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The grounds and hotel were absolutely beautiful. The pools were also fantastic. Our 13 year old son loved the pools/waterpark as well as body surfing in the ocean. I have read reviews were people complained of too many kids and therefore noise around the pools. There is a separate adult pool which I found to be very quite. We were there during spring break and always found lounge chairs during any time of the day...takes a few minutes to hunt them down but we always found something.",

        "content": "I had the pleasure of visiting the Grand Wailea in early December of 2005, and to call it a revelation would be an understatement. I have been fortunate enough to stay at some excellent island hotels in my lifetime, but the Grand Wailea stands head and shoulders above the others. This hotel had everything that I could have wanted in a beachfront hotel. After a long day of travel, we were greeted by cheerful attendants that leid us as bellmen wisked away our luggage. The front desk was also quite welcome- upgrading us to a deluxe garden room along a quiet wing of the hotel. As the bellman took us to our room, he gave us a great tour of the hotel and we took in the grounds as best we could in the middle of the night. Our room was fantastic, with a huge terrace and an amazing bathroom with whirlpool and stall shower. They say garden view, but in a rare bit of humility (a rare thing in the hotel business), this room had garden, ocean and mountain views. In the morning, we paroused the grounds and my suspicions were confirmed- the inky darkness that we looked out on the previous night was a paradise come morning. I really enjoyed this hotel because of the SCOPE of the hotel. It is a large hotel, but never did we feel cramped or inindated with noise. It had cuisine ranging from a simple breakfast place to get pastries to fine dining- it had pool areas for families AND adults. This hotel had taken into consideration EVERYONE that visited it. Whether you wanted a $10 or a $40 breakfast, whether you wanted to play in the family pool on the slide complex (do it at least once, its that impressive) or slip into the quiet hibiscus pool with a drink and a private cabane waiting for you when you get out, this place was perfect. *****- a wonderful combination in a package that doesnt overwhelm, the Grand Wailea is a keeper, and should be higher on this list of Maui's best hotels. A couple of tips: the water slides close 5pm and there is no shuttle service to anything on the island, so seriously consider renting a car if you wish to leave hotel property.",

        "content": "While I've never felt compelled to review a hotel before, I felt the the expectation of this hotel was far enough from the reality that I had to warn potential visitors. First of all, the room that we received was dingy, in major need of an update, and an enormous disappointment in general. I went downstairs to request an upgrade and they did accommodate us with a room in the concierge tower. The bellhop who took our luggage from the old room to the new explained to us that the room was handicapped accesible and in the area that had not yet been renovated. I got the strong feeling that they try to pass this section of rooms off to people who might otherwise not complain and just accept it - much like a bad table in a restaurant. While the new room was an improvement, it was still not what I expected from this hotel. The room was merely average at this point as far as I was concerned. The next thing that struck me was the clientele. Not a refined bunch to say the least. This was surprisingly a very tatooed, twenty-something, roudy type of crowd. Very small on manners and big on implants. Looked more like spring break in Fort Lauderdale. Staff not too polished either. Last complaint is the food. Mediocre at best. We did have a nice (not spectacular) dinner, however at Humu. If I were to do it again, we would stay at the Four Seasons. Much smaller and less impressive grounds (the reason we chose not to stay there in the first place), but much more refined clientele and staff. More in line with what we were anticipating from Grand Wailea. The beach has nothing on Kannapali - where we went next. Very happy that we only had two nights at Grand Wailea.",

I used to stay there almost every year but every time I went, the maintanence of the hotel seemed to be going more and more down-hill. Also, the water in the pools is not heated so if it's not really hot, it gets ridiculously cold. So cold that one year, not one person was in the pool during most of my stay!! The hotel is very beautiful but can get very crowded with conventions and then it becomes overly busy and soon your serene vacation is ruined with kids running around like maniacs. Also, one year, the valet damaged my rental car. Wailea is my favorite area on Maui because it stays dryer. I recommend staying at another hotel in the Wailea area and going over and visiting the Grand Wailea and see if it's for you for a future trip.",

        "content": "Our family stays at 5 star/apple resorts every year so we have apples to compare with this apple. To put it succinctly......the resort is outrageously pricey and does not provide the services the guests should be entitled to after already paying for overpriced rooms. Examples are the $14 hamburgers (not gourmet) at the pool side and a $26 breakfast buffet that is just so so, paying $120 or more per day for cabanas. ( Shade around the pool is at a premium). Customer service was stretching to make average. The spa was nice, but customer service in the spa and spa shop were surprisingly poor. Guest should not have to pay an $18.00 resort fee. The list goes on. The size of the room for the price was just okay. The bathroom is very nice, except we noticed that there was mold moderate mold in grouting between tiles in shower. The maid service did not clean the room well each day and we were tipping $7-8 each day. To worsen matters, the hotel put a hold of several thousand $$$ on our credit card even though, we had prepaid for our 8 day stay there. This turned out to be a major problem that took up too much of our vacation time to straighten out. In all fairness the manager, in the end gave us about a $500 credit for the inconvenience after I insisted they credit us for one nights stay. This was a compromise. It took them 3 days to get the matter corrected. Then we had smoke from the adjoining room coming through the cracks of the door between the two rooms. I have a serious lung condition and notified the front desk about the cigarette smoking in a non-smoking area. Their solution was to offer to move us to another room. I responded no, we were not going to waste anymore of our vacation time resolving problems they create.....a better solution would be to notify the other guest and ask them to desist from smoking or to move them. Again, poor customer service. In the end they put a air ionizer in our room. Thankfully, we were leaving the next day. What's good about this place? The grounds are stunningly beautiful, a great stretch of beach connected to the resort and the artwork throughout the resort is magnificent! The bathroom area is a plus for size and design. This kind of beauty can be experienced for less $$$ and with staff that treat you like royalty, or at least a valued guest. Hint.....If you do visit this resort, try eating breakfast at the restaurant next door at the Wailea shoppes. It's very good and won't cost you an arm & a leg. Generally speaking, food away from the resort is reasonably priced and I recommend dinner at the golf course up the road. Very nice! We also ate at the Four Seasons. The dinner was was wonderful and the service was perfect!!!!",

We did not have any of the problems noted in the other reviews. The staff was freindly and helpful and the resort is as beautiful as we remembered it. We had an ocean view across the chapel. I would think that if there is a party out there, it would be disturbing. There is presently construction next door so if you are on that side of the hotel, you may hear some hammering and the beeping of trucks backing up. We last went just after 9/11 when the resort and the island were empty. We were mentioning this to the bellman as he came up with our bags. He was with them back then and he made a point of saying that the management did not lay anyone off during the recession following the trade center attacks. All staff were instructed to come in as usual even though the resort was pretty much empty. To me that says a lot for the people who run this place.",

The food was good though we never did eat dinner here (ate at Ruth's Chris..ummm). Just lunch at the restaurant near the adult pool and breakfast. I thought the lunch at the pool was excellent, and the service was great! Our room was located on the first floor very near the pool with a lovely view of the chapel and gardens. You could see the ocean if you really looked, but that was ok as I knew our next stop had a complete view of the ocean so I wasn't going to be missing anything. I loved it...totally serene and even saw someone getting married. Very pretty. Very easy to get to the pool! The bathroom was large and decorated tastefully. I thought everything about the hotel was worth the price. Just beautiful and the pools looked like a lot of fun. The disappointment for me was that our room smelled like mildew and with the fan blowing overhead all night the smell gave me a horrible headache. If you are like me and have a sensitivity to smells, this might bother you too. I felt sick most of the day after our first night so I could not do all the fun things I had wanted to do (especailly go down the water slide!!! Darn!!!) When I woke up the next day, same thing...headache. So, that pretty much ruined everything. As soon as I could get fresh air (which I rushed out of the room and didn't enjoy relaxing in it at all) I was better, but really disappointed that the smell was in the room. I did not mention it to the hotel staff....I loved where the room was located, I did not want to have to pack and unpack while feeling so poorly and I knew it was only 2 nights. My husband thought the place had an unfriendly air to it....not due to the staff but more the guests. Too many people on cell phones non-stop gabbing while laying out at the pool! Come on guys! You're in Maui! RELAX! Guess we are more \"kick back\" as we loved staying in Kanapali. Seems a little more relaxed to us. Anyway....the place is a dream but.......ask about the mildew.....I swear the carpet felt damp. I have no idea how they would have handled the situation had I complained but I hated to start out my vacation complaining. Aloha!",

None the less that was only minor to what the resort was all about. No matter what you like to do on your vacation this place had it all. It was right next door to a beautiful outdoor mall (the shops at wailea). You could lay out on the beach, swim in one of the 6 pools, go down the water slides, shop, eat, bike, hike, sightsee, you name it you can do it at the wailea.

I don't know how I would feel about all the families if I was a honeymooner, but hey, I'm 36 and I LOVE a good waterslide so if you are comfortable with happy kids around you, you will be happy here. Booked a terrace room (least $$$) in the Molokini wing. Our view was of the mountain and the 4 Seasons next door. After extensively touring the resort and taking advantage of its many facilities, I think the location of our room was ideal! Close to the pool & beach and also convenient get a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast at the cafe. We didn't experience any long hikes anywhere we wanted to go. We met a family staying in the Napua (concierge) while tir room was lovely, we had to take two elevators to get there from the pool. Ugh. The pool and beach area is excellent. It's windy and split up into several areas. I think this design accommodates the crowds well because we never felt like we were swarmed by people. We got the same spot at the pool every day. If you like convenient access between beach and pool, the GW is ideal. Both the Fairmont Kea lani & the 4 Seasons wailea are beautiful but you either sit at the pool OR the beach, not both. The pool area at GW flows seamlessly into the beach, including the public beach walk. It has very good feng shui in that regard. Meals at the resort were disappointing overall. Food at the pool is way overpriced and bland. After 5 days I was tired of the same salads and sandwiches. We enjoyed two lovely dinners at Bistro Molokini where the food was good but not memorable. Our best meal was the buffet breakfast at the 4 seasons-it was an easy early morning walk and a great food. Camp Grande was great. We never dropped our children off there but you can freely use the facility at your leaisure. There are video games and computer games and two nice toy rooms for kids. It was a great place to hang out before dinner. We also took the kids to a hula class and a lei making class at the camp. They charge a ridiculous $20 for each session, but the kids had a blast. Counselors were lovely and seemed to truly enjoy their jobs. About the spa. WOW! I booked a lava stone massage. After the first hour in the hydrotherapy baths, I could have gone home happy. The massage was icing on the cake. My experience at the spa was fabulous. I thought the staff was friendlyand gracious but not overly so. I had no complaints other than the fact that I spent over $200 in less than two hours. We were all sad to leave the Grand Wailea. The thing was, while we were there, we hadn't seen Hawaii! We couldn't bring ourselves to leave the resort too long. It's really a destination resort because there is enough to do (or not do) that you are completely satisfied. All of our sightseeing took place after we left and were staying in Kaanapali. The Grand Wailea was just too good to be apart from for long. I can't wait to return!",

Staff was the friendliest we've encountered almost anywhere, including stays at larger resorts and luxury hotels. The location was perfect - right across from the beach and within walking distance of numerous restaurants. The only downside was the parking lot view, but I'm sure we could have paid a little more for the other view. Our friends were staying at a small hotel in Wailea and our hotel was definitely better and more convenient.",

There is entertainment by the pool from 6 to 8: none of which is resembling Hawaiian which we missed. They are getting very cheap, no paper or pan by the phone. A gingerale at the bar was $3.50 with a lot of ice and not much drink for my tummy. The bar food is extremely skimpy and over prices for what is on the plate. The hot tubs are very nice for those with arthritis or miss being in hot water at home.",

The room was very open, doesn't feel cramped at all. We had trouble figuring out the shower and ended up calling the technician to come up because we thought it was broken. Apparently nothing was wrong, it was just a tricky shower. This was one of the cheap but still modern hotels in Maui. If you are looking for a resort kind of hotel, then this is not for you. But if you plan on hanging out all day and then just coming back to a good place for the night and to sleep, then Maui Coast Hotel is definitely a choice.",

I must say that, thanks to overall good management and maintenance, timely remodeling and consistency in providing very good service to guests this property remains my favorite when staying on South Maui. The free WiFi internet access from every room is now a real plus as well as is free parking. However, donâ€™t be fooled: these perks and others are not really free so to speak and come with a mandatory USD17.50 + tax daily resort fee, something unique and contagious within Hawaiiâ€™s resorts that is simply extorsion to me. The deluxe minisuite room I was given was clean, quiet and smelled good with each and every items serviceable and was in line with my bookingâ€™s requests. I was therefore disappointed by the somewhat noisy window mounted not split A/C unit that made me use airplaneâ€™s earplugs in order to be less disturbed by the loud rumbling and vibrations. The flat panel TV set is hooked on a wall facing the sofa. However, since this TV is not moveable watching programs from your bed is not comfortable since you only get a limited side view. Housekeeping though well performed was taking place randomly from 9:am to 4pm thus being done most of the time when you donâ€™t expect it. Many times we came back from the beach around 3:30 PM to discover that our room was not ready forcing us to go down to the pool for an extra hour before being able to take a much needed shower in our room. However, these CONs will not prevent me from staying another time at this property next year.",

We were there in Feb. for a month and loved every minute. We have booked to go \"again\" this coming February 2012. The beach is right across the street and shopping is close by. Spices restaurant is great for breakfast, but with so many restaurants close by - try them out. We have not had a terrible meal anywhere in Maui. The Maui Coast is simply affordable and very comfortable and very clean and soooo wonderful. Love it and cudos to the great staff.

We had our own fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker in our room. 3. We could use the washer and dryers (located on the even floors) for free. 4. They provided beach/pool towels. 5. Happy hour at the bar from 3-6pm and a live band at the pool from 6-9pm. 6. The hotel is in walking distance to many eateries, shops and beaches. 7. If you wanted to go somewhere within 3 miles, the hotel shuttle would drive you there. 8. The pool wasn't large, but it was never crowded. 9. Bikes are offered to use at no charge if you would like. 10. Extremely comfortable beds. 11. Provided cotton balls, Q-tips, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathroom. The only thing I can think of that we didn't like about this hotel was the small parking spaces, but you'll find this all over the island.",

        "content": "Hotel is in a great location for getting to various locations on the island. There are many great aspects to this hotel. The most important thing to remember is that this is not a resort, this is a hotel. So, certain amenities are not available. HOTEL Hotel lobby is beautiful and open. Nicely appointed furniture, very clean, and easy to access driveway and parking. Hotel fees are $17.50 a day per room. I saw on Expedia that it said $15.00, but that's incorrect as of January 2011. Hotel Service Associates: Absolutely professional. Wonderful customer service and always friendly. Pool: Very clean. Small, but nice and usually enough chairs available. 2 spa options and 1 pool. Nice pool bar with eating tables. Bathroom was very clean. The only issue was that there were people from outside of the hotel that were allowed to use the pool because the security on the grounds doesnâ€™t have directions from management to not allow non-guests to use the pool. We saw one particular situation where a guest was upset over a non-guestâ€™s behavior. ***Be aware, not everyone at the pool and bar are paying patrons to the hotel.*** Bike Rentals: you can rent 10 speed and beach cruisers for free (this is included in the $17.50 per day). Rooms: Very clean. Odd numbered rooms have a great views of the mountains and the ocean. Our room had a beautiful sunrise and sunset view. We had a remodeled suit which was large, had a mini kitchenette area, 2 flat screen televisions, couch in the living room, king bed in the bedroom, and 2 sliding doors. Large bathroom with great water pressure. Bathroom has a mirror that does not fog up while taking a shower. It leaves the middle area on the mirror unfogged which was great! Bathtub side was a bit high (especially if you're short), so watch your shins. Parking: Ample parking. Well lit and safe. Cafe O'le was a great lunch spot and close to the hotel after you get off the plane and wait for your room. Maui Coffee was excellent and close to the hotel. 4 Seasons Hotel has great restaurants. Ferraro's was excellent.",

The air conditioner in our room was very loud. Otherwise, the room was nice. It had high-quality bedding, high-quality towels, nice furniture and a flat-screen TV. I especially liked the electricity outlets at the bottom of the light units, providing plenty of outlets to recharge all electronics. The staff was friendly. The pool is basic compared to some of the larger resorts. There is a bar/cabana next to the pool. I did not go to the beach, but it is a somewhat long walk due to the length of the Maui Coast Hotel and the street crossing.

        "content": "Let's get the negatives out of the way first. It's not on the beach. It's not in the loveliest part of Maui (Kihei in general is looking pretty old). The restaurant needs a complete overhaul. So, why stay here at all? Because you will not receive finer service anywhere. The staff, from front desk to housekeeping to the shuttle drivers, are all simply wonderful. Your room will be short on luxury but very long on comfort. Our one bedroom suite had a fabulous king bed as well as a sofabed in the living room area, and had 2 plasma TV's. I believe most rooms come with a mini fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. The room was kept spotless by our kind and lovely housekeeper, who always asked what time she should service the room. I locked myself out of the room one day with no ID etc. One of the desk clerks actually delivered a new room key to me where I was sitting by the pool. Now that is service!!! We liked the complimentary shuttle, which will take you 3 miles in either direction. To the north you'll find plenty of strip malls with grocery stores and casual eateries. To the south you can get a ride to Wailea, full of gorgeous resorts, restaurants and a shopping mall. Also complimentary are bikes and use of 3 computers in the lobby. The pool is okay, nothing fancy but attractive enough and we could usually find a vacant chaise. We did not care for the adjoining bar or the restaurant. Breakfast is fine, but we were served a couple of inedible lunches and decided to skip it for the remainder of our 2 week stay. We also liked that we could walk to a great beach in about 5 minutes, and 2 more great beaches were beyond that. There re plenty of small sandwich joints across from all the beaches, so having a picnic on the beach is no problem. We'd highly recommend this place overall. If you are coming to Kihei for any length of time, you may want to consider renting a beachfront condo with a kitchen. If you're going for business, or for a short stay to check out this side of Maui, you couldn't do any better. MAHALO to all staff who went out of their way to make our stay pleasant.",

Rooms were quiet, clean, and modern; our room was outside of the elevator, and we never heard a peep. We appreciated the fridge/microwave but never had the chance to use it; did not use restaurants/room service/fitness area either. Front desk was genuinely friendly and helpful. We stayed Christmas week, and even though they were booked, they permitted us to have a bit of a late check-out. Pool water was a bit cool/crisp, but it would be a waste to have a pool heater due to Maui's warm temperatures. Pool and hot tubs were very clean. Enjoyed the music in the pool areas in the evenings. Liked the hotel's proximity to the beaches and the rest of the island. Definitely would stay here again.",

No hospitality room to take a shower when you have a late flight: you may use the cold shower at the pool and carry your wet clothes with you or pay US$ 120 when you want to stay in your room a couple of hours longer than checkout time.

The location is good too, in Kihei only a few minutes' drive from all manner of shopping, dining, etc. They did have a notice that they were remodeling and there might be some noise between 11 and 3 during the day, but as we had plans and were out of the building, it didn't detract any from our stay.",

        "content": "I stayed at the Maui Coast Hotel for the Thanksgiving long weekend. Upon checking in very late at night the desk agent assigned a room on the first floor but advised me to check back the next morning to get a room higher up in the hotel. After checking back the next morning I was given a room on the third floor (reservation was for an ocean view room and I never got one but since I was only paying $150 per night I couldn't really complain). TIP: odd numbered rooms or rooms on the top three floors have ocean views... no ocean view from the first or third floor on the even numbered side of the hotel. The grounds of the hotel were clean and attractive. I never swam in the pool but it appeared to be a nice set up. The rooms were a bit dated and the air conditioning was loud. The bathroom was clean but very very small... and it had the most annoying shower curtain that was short and would blow into the shower while showering... when I tried to correct this I ended up flooding the floor... no winning with that! I found the hotel to be quite quiet given the fact that it was booked solid. Free internet in the lobby and free parking were a nice bonus as was the mini refrigerator in the room. The hotel is situated across from the beach in busy Kihei but since it is set back from the road it was quite quiet. I ate breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant and it was okay, service was friendly but slow. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend, probably not as I would recommend a condo instead (a condo is a must if you are traveling with children). However, if you needed a place to stay for one or two nights then this is an okay choice.",

Being four adult women crammed together in a double bed and a sleeping couch is not my idea of a vacation! Even though the staff tried their best we chose to move after the first night. Coming all the way from Europe I expect more from a hotel in Maui. It was poorly situated between buildings with no sight of anything green (except of course for Haleakala in the background) and you had to cross a road to get to the beach. I know of other much nicer and better hotels in the same pricerange placed on the beach near Lahaina, where the view is a whole lot better!",

Extremely friendly personnel make your check-in a breeze. The fact that we were upgraded to an ocean view made it even more special. The large rooms are everything you expect from a first class resort. The resortâ€™s biggest amenity is its location. The beautiful beach is the envy of south Maui. Most snorkel trips travel to this beach because of the great abundance of sea creatures, including octopi, turtles and eels. Truly some of the best snorkeling Iâ€™ve personally ever enjoyed. The pool is simple but very inviting, and the waitstaff will take care of everything you need. We enjoyed the Friday night seafood buffet, and the chef personally cut select sushi for us. The golf course offers some of the best views of Molokini on the island, and was a joy to play. We enjoyed a couple of drinks and a wonderful sunset at the â€œCafÃ© on the Greenâ€� after golf.

Previously we had stayed at this resort when it was the Maui Prince and while we loved the location it was in need of some upkeep. When we were able to stay again on this trip we were so excited to see what had been done. The hotel and grounds have definately seen improvements. There seems to be more staff and the service was friendly and consistant. We were greeted each day, from the front desk staff, the breakfast servers and the gardeners with a big smile and an Aloha. The breakfast buffet that was included in our room rate was superb. From made to order omlettes, fresh fruit and waffles and pancakes there was something for everyone. The beach is what keeps bringing us back. Even though the hotel was full the beach was never crowded. My husband and daughter were able to swim out to Turtle Town right from the front of the hotel. The nice surprise this time was the added activities that were available to guests with a variety each day. We went to the \"Night Under The Stars\" and found the whole experience a lot of fun. Becky was informative, entertaining and enthusiastic. Whether you are a couple or a family there is something for everyone. The location was perfect and the fire and smores just added to the experience. We have only been home for two days and we are already talking about when we can return. My only hope is that with all the improvements to the property they do not raise the rates to the point that we can no longer afford to stay here. This is truly our dream vacation spot.",

        "content": "A great location but the rooms and service are uneven. The resort is south of Wailea on a secluded, beautiful beach, but still close enough to take advantage of the restaurants in Wailea or Kihei. We were told at check-in that the room renovations had been complete. Our room was comfortable with a partial ocean view and a lovely lanai, but the carpet was dirty in several places. Occasionally, we found tiny bugs in the bathroom. Whatâ€™s worse was all the light switches were filthy! Iâ€™ve never experienced that anywhere. We had purchased a package on Expedia that included the breakfast buffet (normally $25pp). The selection was great. Two days we had great service (bringing beverages and removing plates) but the third day we had to ask for coffee after looking for a server for 10 minutes. The service at the pool at lunch time was also poor. (There is nowhere else to eat at the resort at lunch time.) When we first arrived at the pool, the waitperson kept asking us if we wanted to order and we said not yet. When we told her we were ready to order, she forgot about us for about 15 minutes. She also forgot a couple of other things that we requested during the afternoon. We were there in early December and the resort seemed like it had were more staff than guests. Maybe the resort was still getting back to normal after the renovation, but it was a little spooky with only a few people around. In sum, I think I would stay there again because of the location and beach and hope that the service and cleanliness had improved.",

        "content": "Here's the deal with this property. It's obvious that the new owners are still dealing with a massive restructuring/remodeling/rebranding project since acquiring the property last year. The result is that the prior negative reviews referencing the Adams Family, Hitchcock films, etc. are not completely offbase as the hotel is a bit stark and bland in general. I had already stayed for a few nights in West Maui so I only wanted 2 days/1 night in the Wailea area to check out South Maui before I left the island. I didn't want to pay $500+ for the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea and was able to book Makena for $199 inclusive of breakfast and the resort fee. The manager upgraded me to a better Ocean View room when I checked in without my having to badger him for it...in fact, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful the entire time I was there and are an asset to the hotel. I can confirm the prior reviews regarding the room...great views, nice bed, bland decor, elements that make you shake your head at the design flaws, cheap patio furniture that I constantly tripped over, etc. The hotel beach is nice. If you have a car drive to Big Beach 5 minutes down the road. Bottom line with this place is that it is a great value for South Maui if you get the room for a great rate, are not expecting a posh manicured Four Seasons/Grand Wailea experience, and are using it as a base to explore the island rather than sitting by the pool all day.",

Safe calm water in the a.m. for all family snorkeling and still fantastic for a swim in the afternoons. Turtles too! Now for such a great review i should get a comp but... well... they deserve it . Great place... unless you want a condo for big family. Even then you gotta visit the beach for a snorkel....on a scale of 1 to six i would rate this a 5 star",

OMG, they were all extremely happy people. super nice people. and yes, they do charge a 25 dollar per day resort fee, but that means 1) you dont have to tip anybody hahahah and 2) you get tons of free stuff like parking, shuttle service, towels, coffee and tea. its not that big of a deal honestly. the main reason i chose this place was b/c its off the beaten path and its the closest resort to Big Beach and Little Beach, which are THE beaches to go to in Maui. you can walk on foot for about 15 minutes and be at these amazing beaches; super convenient. probably the best vacation i've had in a while, and i travel extensively :) maui rocks and makena def contributed to the good vibes.",

The male staff in the front desk asked us to present the booking confirmation email letter to him for check-in. He looked so impatient as I had taken quite a long time to find out the letter from our bags. Since then, he didn't smile at all, and had a poker face toward us, and very impatient to our questions regarding the hotel facilities and internet access. I understand his job may be stressful. But his behavior just made us feel unwelcome, disrespectful and upset after a long and tired flight trip to Maui and this quality of service is unacceptable as it is a 4-star resort. In addition, the room is clean but a bit old and certainly update is needed. Other staffs are really friendly and helpful and I would like to say thank you for their quality service. Overall, the location and the facilities of the resort are good but the front desk service we received were really bad and disappointed.",

        "content": "For our second trip to Maui, we booked a 7 night stay at a major chain resort at Wailea, Maui, HI. Because of false advertisement of policy at the chain resort, we checked out of the chain the next morning . . . things were not looking good. We used our Frommer's Guide to try to find another resort on Maui for our next 6 nights. Frommer's listed this resort, formerly known as Maui Prince as an 2.5 star rating at the end of its list of resort listings. Going down the list and fearing that we were going to have to hotel hop (Kea Lani could put us up for 4 nights), we finally got to the end of the list and this listing. From the moment the reservationist answered our call, everything went \"right.\" Even though she didn't show an availability for 6 nights, understanding our dilemma, she put us on hold to speak with upper management and successfully secured us a room with balcony for the entire 6 nights for around $300 per night which included 24 hr. internet service, resort fee and valet parking (as we found at the chain all of this is very pricey). Given our situation (Maui for 6 nights and no lodging), we left the chain and headed south fearing what shape 2.5 stars meant. When we pulled into the resort, we thought for certain we were at the wrong place . . . it was beautiful, just like you would imagine an Hawaiian resort, the grounds beautifully landscaped. We were greeted at the entrance with leis, the first we had received since arriving in Hawaii. We went to the front desk and Ron greeted us warmly and seemed to know in advance of our prior troubles (my husband was still fuming about the chain) and entertained us with assurances and calm. At 9 a.m. our room was not ready and we certainly understood that since we had made the reservation 30 minutes earlier. In the meantime, Ron encouraged us to have breakfast and use the property while the room was being readied. We were greeted to a changing room with full bath, so that we could use the pool and beach and our valuables were safely locked up for us. The lobby areas were refreshing, breezy and really pretty with great Koi ponds. From the moment we pulled into the resort, our vacation was saved and wonderful, thanks to the Makena Beach & Golf Resort. The room with a giant balcony and oceanview was large and roomy and all amenities (coffee make, mini-frig, hairdryer, safe) were provided Our room was bright, clean and airy. We noticed that the rooms will be being redecorated during 2011, but our accommodations were great, very pleasantly appointed. The layout of the hotel and rooms are great, all the rooms seem to have an oceanview and through your room entrance, a view of the gorgeous mountainside. The gift-shop had everything one needed and was very reasonably priced. They stock sodas, chips, cookies, beer, and even stocked my favorite Merlot. There is also a coffee bar (Starbuck's coffee) with freshly made picnic foods, here the hotel offers a complimentary local newspaper Monday thru Saturday. All service was friendly, expedient and excellent. I ordered room service coffee every morning, breakfast on the balcony and late afternoon cocktails (and the room service staff seemed to anticipate my call). They seemed to know who I was and what I wanted. The food on site was excellent. An extraordinary breakfast buffet was available with inside/outside dining everyday. The Molokini Bar & Grill for the evening was excellent, some of the best food I've eaten and Celia, our waitress, was a sweetheart. The oceanside spa was excellent and had a great massage by well-trained therapist, I melted into nirvana while inhaling a wonderful aroma under a soft ocean breeze. The beach, ah, one of the largest in Maui. Unlike the chain resort with no real beachfront, the Makena Beach & Golf Resort fronted a very big and deep beach. We stayed at the Kea Lani in 2001 and this 5 star at the time fronts a very small beach but big pools - why go to the ocean to sit at a pool; we have a pool at home. And location, location, location: at the very end of Wailea, but this is a good thing too; it is the last resort along resort-row, just above Makena Beach and Oneloa (Big Beach), making it away from the most congested tourist and shopping traffic. I can't say enough good things about this resort, we felt truly pampered during our stay and have now been introduced to the Preferred Hotel Group, we will look for them again.",

The Makena Golf Resort is the last resort on the south side of the island. It's quiet and less crowded compared to the west side of the island. The resort has a charming old school Hawaiian feel to it. The views from the rooms were exquisite. The pool was a little small but the resort was not packed so it wasn't a problem. If the resort had been at full capacity I think it would have been an issue. The beach right in front of the resort is gorgeous! We so enjoyed it, great snorkeling, lots of turtles and not overly crowded. The rooms were prefect for us. They were not updated, but they were clean, comfortable and had a nice feel. I would definitely go back. My disclaimer: We booked our rooms on priceline for a discounted rate. If I had paid full price, I'm not sure my review would be so glowing.

Every time we left our room, we were greeted by the nice staff, the grounds people and the front desk staff. Everyone was so friendly and always asked if there was anything we needed or anything they could do for us, to make our stay better. After staying a few nights we were suppose to transfer to a condo in Kihei. We ended up adding another night and gave up our condo. My husband and I have already talked about going back to the Makena beach Resort for our 1st anniversary.",

        "content": "Lukewarm staff, sketchy housekeeping, worn beach towels (if you can get them, as they tend to run out). Got charged $5 \"room service delivery fee\" to borrow some plates/silverware for use in the room â€“ something we have never encountered elsewhere. Rooms are worn and carpet is dirty. Found other people's hair in room upon arrival and housekeeping appears to do minimal in the rooms during our stay. Also had problem with people in adjacent rooms smoking on their lanai â€“ prohibited by hotel but nothing you can do because the rooms do not face each other and you have no idea which room it is coming from. However, very, very quiet hotel and great for couples wanting to get away. Great access to beach and free beach chairs are fairly plentiful, especially in the afternoon. Parking was very easy. Recommend this hotel if you can get it for good price and can overlook their shortcomings (mostly the oldness and cost cutting). Found several mistakes on our bill at check out so please review before you sign.",

        "content": "First, to qualify this review, let me say that my husband and I have stayed at the \"Pink Palace\" in Waikiki, the Mauna Lani on the Big Island (twice), and the Bora Bora Nui & Intercontinental (Papeete) in French Polynesia. We live in an ocean resort on the Atlantic (Maryland), so we are no newcomers to beach/resort hotels (at the high end). As frequent travelers, we rely pretty heavily on the reviews posted here in our decision making. I am barely able to post this review, because I fear, that if word gets out about this hotel, no one will ever be able to get a room here again. So, here goes: If you want a pretty secluded and safe beach, it's here (remember-all beaches are public in HI); if you want a very affordable, decent rate for an ocean-front no frills hotel, it's here; if you want the feel of 'old Hawaii' with all of the Aloha and the Wailea location, it's here; great food--not here, good food, yes, but not great; best sunset lounge that's not on the beach, it's here; big-time, over-the-top nightlife, not here, but good Hawaiian entertainment several nites during the week, it's here; friendly staff--Jay, Kai, Michelle, Amy to name a few--nothing is ever a problem; great bed, clean room with plenty of towels, soap, etc, it's here; if you want lots of kiddie amenities, maybe another choice is wiser; if you want quiet, quiet, quiet, a large hotel and grounds where you have space to wander and relax, this is it. If you need glitz and noise, overworked valets, and stroller races in the lobby (yes, I witnessed this on a walk-through at another hotel that has a \"four\" in its name), then go for all of that at the mouth of Wailea. Makena Beach (formerly the Maui Prince) is a wonderful alternative to the overpriced crowded chaos at the other end of this road. We are only sorry we could not stay longer--8 nites was not long enough at this little spot on Maui. (And yes, do eat at Mama's & Gannon's & Da Kitchen in Lahaina. -- all good, really good.) We're still trying to figure our review on Spago at the \"4 . . . Hotel.\"",

We arrived New Years Eve and had tried to get into 5* restaurants in other hotels but they were all booked so we decided we would dine in the resort. Both my husband and I felt the New Years Eve chef's menu was one of the best meals we have had and we travel alot. For $52/pp we had a 3 course menu with wine pairings and the food was amazing especially the main course Beef Tenderloin. We are from Alberta Canada and know our beef and felt this was one of the best cuts. We didn't dine any other time so no comment on daily fare but the New Years Eve was special.

        "content": "My husband and I decided on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. We booked the trip through American Airlines Vacations in January, for travel in September. We chose the â€œ4-Starâ€� vacation package, which included 4 nights at the Maui Prince in Makena, and 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. Throughout the time from January to September, I was in contact with various members of the concierge staff at the Maui Prince to plan activities for our stay. They were always so gracious and helpful, and I felt like a valued guest with every communication. Just before our trip, I learned that the Maui Prince was under new management (had become the Makena Resort), and got a little nervous about the reservations, but no worries! Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. We were greeted with shell leis and refreshing cool towels, as well as a very friendly bell staff and front desk attendant who immediately wished us a happy anniversary and gave us an upgrade to our room at no additional charge. We were booked in a partial ocean view room, but got a beautiful ocean view room instead. It wasnâ€™t the â€œtop of the lineâ€� room, but it was ocean view, and we didnâ€™t have to pay extra! I cannot give enough praise to the staff, as they were all extremely friendly and helpful, and absolutely exuded the spirit of aloha, from the front desk to the pool bar, to the wait staff in the restaurants, and the housekeeping staff. Fabulous service â€“ always with a warm smile! The beach in front of this hotel is extremely beautiful and uncrowded. It is a small beach, but all the more cozy and private. I might add that this resort is on the southwest coast of Maui, not in the Kaâ€™anapli area up north, where it is apparently much more commercial. This resort is about a 30-minute drive from the airport. We were within 10-20 minutes of all the shopping we could ask for, from a Safeway shopping center to the Shops at Wailea, a very upscale shopping complex with stores like Gucci and Tiffanyâ€™s. The restaurants at the resort served absolutely incredible food. Be forewarned, everything in Maui is quite pricey, but if you know that before you go, there wonâ€™t be too many surprises. I just donâ€™t recommend ordering room service at the resort. One of the â€œmust-doâ€™sâ€� on Maui is a drive on the Hana Highway. Start early in the morning, though, because you will want to make several stops, and it will take you at least 4 hours to get to Hana, if there is light traffic. I recommend getting the CD-guided tour at the Shell station near the airport for $20, well worth it. There are some breathtaking views and gorgeous rainforest scenery along the way, and you will definitely want to see the black sand beach. If we had not gotten the CD package, we would have missed it. The Maui Prince/Makena Resort has a luau one night a week, but we were not there on the right night for it, so we went to the Honuaâ€™ula Luau at the Marriott just up the road for our anniversary dinner â€“ it was AWESOME! I highly recommend it, regardless of where you stay. The food and show are worth every penny of the $100+ per person cost. I would just really like for the staff of the Maui Prince/Makena Resort to know that they made our anniversary trip everything we dreamed it would be - the most wonderful, memorable, romantic trip we have ever taken. I just hope we can go back someday. Mahalo nui loa, Maui Prince/Makena Resort!",

The pool is small but you will want to spend all your time at the beach. Grounds are very lush and very beautiful. We snorkled off the beach every day, and the sea turtles are 10 feet from the beach.

        "content": "We arrived at the Maui Prince after two days in Oahu at the Hawaii Prince and two days in Hotel Hana in Maui. It was our honeymoon which we planned several months in advance. We were looking forward to relaxing for 5 nights at the Maui Prince. First off, the bell men were beyond rude. They never welcomed us with leis as we saw others being welcomed. The moquitos run rampant there which we never had any problem with riding all over Maui. The floors and rooms were dirty. Obviously, they don't clean daily. The front desk was also rude. No Aloha spirit in this place which we had gotten accustomed to in other parts of the island. They gave us a pitiful view for our prime ocean view rate. Our shower made a loud banging noise which went from hot to cold to scalding hot while you showered. It also lost most the pressure during use. We asked for a room change or maintenance to fix which they said they did during our dinner. We tried out the hotel restaurant since it' s in the middle of nowhere. The food was mediocre at best with very high prices. The service from wait staff and hostess was also snobby. The other dinner restaurant was closed for renovation til July. We decided to leave the second day but they were going to charge us the early departure fee of one night stay so the manager upgraded us to ocean front room. The view was better, room larger and separate shower but it was old and dirty also. The pool was always hot and there is only one which we were used to several. If you want a nice place to stay, you can get a better rate in Lahaina or Ka-anapali Beach at the Westin, etc with better view and many pools and restaurants. I think people go there to have quiet, but it's not going to happen if that's your reason with the nightly bird convention in lobby and loud shower and faucets. It's falling apart and in need or an upgrade or serious rate adjustments. They charge daily rate for internet and plus additional charge for parking nightly. Rape you every way they can. NOt ideal for honeymoon at all.",

        "content": "My husband and I recently stayed at the Maui Prince hotel. We went to Maui to get married and to honeymoon. I must say, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were pretty right on. Hotel The Maui Prince was great in that it was pretty secluded and quiet. The rooms were a little out-dated, but they were comfortable for our needs. The beds were nice and comfortable and everything in the room worked and was pretty clean. I would definitely recommend going for an oceanfront room. It was nice to keep the door open and sleep to the ocean (a luxury we don't get here in KY!) One thing I thought was strange was the water fountain in the garden. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept, but all we could hear until 8pm was the water fountain in the koi pond. The fountain didn't really serve a purpose and overshadowed the ocean for a while. Beach The beach was nice. We easily got lounge chairs and our pick of spots. There was even a guy from the hotel walking around making sure everyone had what they needed and offering cups of water. I would recommend taking a short drive south of the hotel to Big Beach state park. It was pretty empty when we were there and was very serene. Staff The staff was ok. It was nothing to rave about, but we didn't really have any problems. There is free valet parking (a tip of course is expected) or you can self park. I would recommend self parking. The parking lot is not far away and you save yourself the money for tips. However, the first day we arrived, the valets pounced on the car and seemed irked that we did not want to take advantage of their services (I was just being dropped off while my husband parked). Food To be honest, we only ate at the hotel once (excluding the luau). We ate at the pool grill after a day at the beach. The food was good, but pricey for what we got. Iwould highly recommend going to the Shops at Wailea for a couple of meals. Longhis was named \"best breakfast in maui\" and we couldn't agree more! Everything is homedmade, the service was great, and the atmosphere was laid back. I was hesitant at first because it looked like a fancy restaurant, but we saw people in everyhting from board shorts, to work out gear to resort wear in there for breakfast. I would also recommend have lunch or dinner at Cheeseburgers island style. Everything is ala carte on the menu. Also, if you're a pop drinker, I would get the bottomless mug. It pays for itself in 2 refills (refills are not free). If you're around any of the restaurants (wailea or lahaina), you can take the cup in for a refill. Each room has a minifridge in it. I would recommend going up to Safeway (on Pi'Ikea near Hilo Hatties) and get some drinks and snacks to keep in the room. It saves money and the hassle of running to a vending mchine. I apologize this review is lengthy, but I've always found Trip Advisor useful and wanted to share my experience.",

        "content": "Before booking this stay, we checked many reviews. So we tought it would be ok, except when we got there...everything was amazing! First of all, I want to adress the issue of the decor. I know hotels in the States really focus on the rooms, while for us it's more about the overall experience. The rooms aren't new, but the furniture and design are very, very classy and eternal. If remodernised now, it would end up looking just like the other hotels. This one has an elegant soul. The whole layout of the hotel is wonderful. There's the spacious terraced lobby overlooking the internal garden and the koi carp pond, also the other hotel grounds were the most beautiful tropical garden there could be. The beach in front of it is also beautiful. The views of Molokini (specially sunset and sunrise) are quite something. It's a resort, but since we went there in September after Labor day, it wasn't crowded at all. That was also noted by other reviews. Since the sheer size of the hotel, we would never really grasp the number of people staying at the time. However, when we went to the morning yoga session on the lawn overlooking the beach, it was almost like having a private instructor. The staff in general was great, helped us with planning all our other activites in Maui. About the location, yes, it fells amazingly secluded since it's the last hotel in south Makena, close to some great looking beaches (Big Beach, Small Beach, La Perouse Bay is also nearby). But if you have a rental car, and you probably want to have it for you trip to Maui, you can reach Wailea in minutes, than take the highway bypassing Kihei and from there on to the other attractions of the island. We felt that if we were to stay in Kaanapali, the drive to the other sights would have been much longer, since the road to Lahaina isn't as fast as the highway close to Kihei. Just one caveat, the shack next to the beach renting snorkling gear & other equippment is overpriced. There are many great restaurants in Maui, so we didn't eat at our hotel up to our last night when we just ordered room service. We were again surprised, the food was very good and the menu quite imaginative (for a room service menu). The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey. We would love to stay at the Maui Prince Hotel again, I don't know what the standard rates are since we booked a package through an online service (although we feel it was a bargain for the superb quality of the hotel).",

        "content": "The maui prince is along the long strip of South Maui hotels...not nearly the caliber of the four seasons or the grand wailea...but then again, the price isnt as ridiculous as well. We were glad we chose the prince though, because you're in hawaii....how much time do you really want to spend in a hotel room? The staff was friendly enough. Seashell leis, cold towels when we got there. The housekeeping kept our room nice & we got a lot of towels from them. The pool was fine, small, but that kept it from being a kid zone. Never had troubles getting spots under the canopies & the drinks were good (though pricey). Hottubs were fine as well. It worked out well for us though. We got on the top floor & had a garden view, but when your view overlooks a lush golf course & a mountain, it's still not bad, so I didnt miss that we couldnt really see the ocean. It's a short walk anyway. The hotel room was slightly dated...could use an upgrade, but it wasnt bad. our shower had a leak in the faucet on the first day, but was fixed by the 2nd. There's a mini fridge in the room that you can use & they give you 2 bottles of water at the beginning. The room safe was free & handy to have. The AC worked fine, though we mostly had our door open w/ the screens because the weather was so nice. Bed was nice & soft, felt great. The tv was kinda lame, but then again, we didnt watch too much. They had internet hookups in the room (for ethernet ports), & I had thought it would be free, but it was about $40 for the week. Our room was on the south side of the hotel & overlooked the garden area where they held the Luaus. THAT got reallllly old after awhile & we were glad we never paid to go to it...we just got a bottle of wine & sat on our lanai & watched. Saved $80 each & we could go inside when it got too cheesy. Instead we went on a dinner cruise & had a great time. We also went on the early morning snorkeling trip from our beach on the Kai Kanaii. The staff there were excellent & it was a great trip, esp since we just walked right out of our room for it. We had breakfast once at the hotel buffet, but only once, as it was $25/person & we felt that was a little overpriced. The birds seem to fly around all over Maui & hop around on tables, so guard your food well...even with good wait staff, they'll take advantage. The beach at our hotel was fantastic...mostly sand & very secluded most of the time. on our snorkel trip we were about 200 ft out from the beach & swam with huge seaturtles (it's one of the 'turtle towns'). About 1/2 mile to the south is a great black sand beach where you can see the turtles from the shore. We never swam there as the water was too rough when we went. Big beach to the south is great too, very classic. Snorkeling around south maui is excellent. We rented equipment at Maui Dive shop (a heck of a lot cheaper than the hotel) & went to as many beaches as we could. BEST ADVICE: buy the \"maui revealed\" book & bring it with you everywhere...it's the best resource for places to see, eat & go.",

        "content": "We just returned from Maui. We stayed at the Maui Prince and the Sheraton Kaanapali. Maui Prince was by far the favorite. We had ocean front rooms in both hotels. At the Prince on the fifth floor, we saw a lovely crescent white sand beach, Lanai and Earthquake Hill in the distance and koi in a landcaped stream right below the room from a spacious lanai. At the Sheraton, we saw a sea wall in building 6 off our balcony with just room for two chairs and a small table and the ocean with no beach. Yes the room at the Sheraton was fresher with a bigger bathroom but the hotel was more crowded and I felt that I could have been at any beach. The bed at the Prince was a winner. At the Prince, there was still a feeling of old Hawaii and relaxation. As a bonus, I could step out of my room at sunrise and see it over Haleakala framed by the huge garden atrium with waterfalls and a stream. At the Prince the beach lounge chairs and pool cabanas and valet parking were complimentary. The Sheraton charged for all three amenities. A lounge chair rental on the beach was $10.00. We did enjoy the luau at the Sheraton with prime seating at ring side for just an extra $10.00 with Maui Adventures. The Sheraton told me prime seating was sold out. All in all we enjoyed the beauty and serenity at the Maui Prince at Makena. Snorkeling off their beach is great and I swam with two sea turtles. There are lots of coves in Makena to explore. Spend the extra $ and rent a convertabile car to see t he island.",

Well, you can't do that anymore, but if you want to walk a trail through the trees to Makena stay here! Soon this classic will be torn down and investors will start over with some huge place that will be way over priced. The Prince still has the ambience and beauty of a stylish garden hotel, and the pictures on line do not lie. The aloha spirit is fabulous as staff will bend over backwards to make your stay comfortable and happy. The rooms are spacious and comfortable enough. We moved to an oceanfront room and spent most of the time on the lanai watching for whales. Because the Prince has lost its reputation for swank, there were not the usual wannabe's we experience at other hotels...and we had the pool virtually to ourselves and a few other readers. The beach in front of the hotel is in a little cove and protected from the wind. We hope to stay here again before it bites the dust...",

The hotel service was nice, friendly and accomadating. The downside of the Prince is there is very few choices for dining. If you just want a causal meal during the day you needed to eat at the pool bar. During the evening the only choice is their high end restaurant, which appearred not to get much activity. For breakfast if you wanted buffet you are at the right spot, however, if you just wanted something light you are out of luck. So you need to go into town which is a 15-20 minute drive. Our biggest gripe was our unfortnate timing with a World Championship competion being held at the hotel during our entire stay. They let us know at arrival that it will be noisy with loudspeakers, helicopters, celebrations etc, I just wish they would of told us when I was making my reservation!",

We had just found flown into Maui and found out, when we picked up our rental car, that the road to Lahaina was closed due to a brush fire. We immediately phoned the hotel in Kaanapali (one of the large ones- which will remain unnamed) where we had been originally booked to stay. We asked for referrals to other hotels under the circumstances and they gave us no information. So, we were essentially - on our own. After trying several hotels in Kihei and Wailea which were booked because of the fire created chaos; and, finding that other hotels that still had rooms were extorting high room fees because they realized people had no choice -- we stumbled upon Maui Prince. What an incredible relief! The atmosphere was extremely relaxed and beautiful. Rather than overcharging, they stated that they understood the predicament of the people caught in the fires and gave us a special rate. The grounds are beautiful. It was like a Zen type atmosphere. The food was great. All of the employees showed extreme courtesy. I highly recommend the Maui Prince Hotel.",

        "content": "Thank Laka (Pele's babe) that the Maui Prince exists! It is the best kept secret on the Ilse of Maui. First off, the beach is fantastic: big, soft sand, good snorkling both to the right and left, and, most importantly, IT IS BASICALLY ONLY USED BY GUESTS OF THE MAUI PRINCE! That final point is the biggest point if you are looking to get away from crowds as part of your reason for going to Hawaii. Also, the resort is the closest to Molokini Crater (where we snorkeled with turtles, sharks and a variety of colorful fish). Next, there are a variety of restaurants on the property, so there is no need to drive into Wailea or Kihei for food. Yes, the food is pricey, probably right up there with the Four Seasons, Kea Lani, or Fairmont in terms of cost. It is good quality, however, and Hawaii in general is like eating in Manhattan, price-wise, let's be honest. As for the rooms, we had a suite at the far end of the hotel, not really an ocean view, but you still hear it all night, plus you get the bird songs (and, unfortunately, a punctual rooster). The hotel does need some love, i.e. bucks, in terms of exterior paint and interior decoration, both in the lobby and in the rooms. It is well kept, but no matter how clean you keep 20 year-old tile and furniture, it is still going to show wear and tear. Let me emphasize again, that it is CLEAN, but the owners do need to fork over the cash and do some basic updating. For example, the \"gym\" facility needs to be scrapped and a new out-building, perhaps near the croquet court, constructed of some 2000 feet to hold the current and new exercise equipment. The Prince sits at a real disadvantage to the \"Big Four\" (\"Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, Fairmount, and the Marriott) in terms of appealling to more fitness conscious clietel (and, take note, Owner: those folks pay UP and a good portion of your current clientel is dying off). If they can't scrape up the $750,000-$1,000,000 for such facility, then they need to sell to someone else. That said, we would highly recommend this resort to those couples and families looking for a restful, interesting (on-site, pretty good luau, salt water swimming pools, etc.), and quiet vacation, this is the place. Our beef with the alternative Big Four is that its like being in Beverly Hills or the Upper East Side: lots of people, super pricey, very noisy, a lot of SEE AND BE SEEN (particularly at Spago at the Four Seasons), and a lot of people who go the Big Four just to tell their friends they went to the Big Four. We actually want to go someplace to go there, not impress others. We get enough fake boobs, spray on tan, swell fellas, snotty kids, etc. where we live, so we wanted something a little different. If you share our viewpoint, then you will be happy you stayed at the Maui Prince.",

        "content": "We were a little worried after reading some reviews but they proved pretty much groundless. Our check-in and welcome was seamless. We arrived early and were given a room right away. The manager sent champagne for our anniversary. With one exception the staff was friendly and efficient and that is important to us after a trip to Kona where the service ranged from surly to incompetent at a hotel there. Believe me, a consultation with the manager and head of security can put a dampner on your trip. (But that's another story.) Our room was comfortable and clean but not luxurious so if marble baths are important to you, find another place. We liked the private lanai with a view. This property is up for sale so hopefully the new owners will make some refurbishing choices in the rooms and bathrooms. Food here was pricey but good. There are plenty of other good restaurants in nearby Wailea or 10 minutes away in Kihei for the more budget-minded. Check out the panoramic view from the golf clubhouse and sit on the beach at night with a canopy of stars overhead and the sound of the surf. Romantic! Maybe you'll see a shooting star like we did. The luaus were constant throughout the visit but they wind up early. If you just want to watch the show walk up the pool path and stand in back to see the Samoan fire dancers. ( Entertainment in the hotel lounge was sedate & not our style.) People seemed to be enjoying the beach and pool, but if this beach isn't enough, gorgeous Big Beach is just down the road. BTW our Entertainment card was accepted w/o question in the Prince Court and Hakone restaurants. If you have a need to see and be seen or are high energy, this place may not be for you. But if you, like us, like a hotel with a Hawaiian feel right on the beach with a relaxing environment, it's wonderful. If you go in the off season, you can save 40 percent off the hotel room and the Entertainment Book for HI can be purchased online at the end of their year (around Aug or Sept) for a greatly reduced price. That's what we did. Aloha!",

Maui is a beautiful island, and the south shore where the Maui Prince is located is particularly beautiful. 2). The Maui Prince is a visually pleasing, moderately priced hotel accentuated by well-kept and aesthetically pleasing grounds. The room had a comfortable king size bed, a tub with a shower and a separate walk-in shower. Great view from lanai ( ocean front room) 3). The beach is a good size, easily accessible and is very good for swimming and snorkeling (Sea Turtles abound). 4). If you golf, there is a beautiful 18 hole course on the grounds of the hotel (a 9 hole mini course as well). The bad: 1). Because of its fairly isolated location, you'll definitely need a rental car to get around, but even more importantly, to take you to affordable restaurants. (We paid $50 including tip for breakfast at the Maui Prince. 2). There is no casual dining at this hotel except at the pool. (There are 2 expensive restaurants). Unless your reservation comes with a meal plan, your best bet is a 15 minute ride to Kihei where you will have several choices. The pool bar, which does have sandwiches at a decent price, is an option for lunch but closes promptly at 6 P.M. 3). 2 swimming pools (not cold as some writers mentioned) but too deep for small children.",

It is the perfect place for anyone seeking a quiet romantic and peaceful time. We had a pretty good view of the ocean and west Maui. The rooms were clean and nice. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The gardens were beautifully designed and well maintained. We booked through Expedia and the fun desk staff (Aribe and Angel) were both great and helped us plan our vacation perfectly. Besides couples like ourselves, we also saw kids having a great time at the beach and by the pool. So don't be fooled into thinking this place is only for couples. The beach was hardly crowded and was very private. Overall, we had a blast and will definitely come back again. Do remember to plan your vacation properly and you will hardly mind the long drives to any sight seeing spots from the hotel.",

So I decided that I would try the Maui Prince to see how it compared to the other hotels. It is not up to par with any of the other hotels in Wailea. The rooms are small, noisy, uncomfortable and out dated. The pool was also a huge disapointment, it is about a 1/4 of the size of all of the other hotels. Most of all the costmer service was extremely disapointing, I would almost say rude at some points. You are better off staying at one of the other hotels in Wailea.",

        "content": "We loved our stay at the Prince and hated to come home. To provide a bit of context, we were choosing between the 4 and 5 star hotels on Wailea--Wailea Grand, Renaissance, Fairmont, etc... We went with the Prince and in no way regretted it. Those other resorts are DEFINITELY more luxurious. So if you want 5-star luxury in your room, you'll be dissapointed in the Prince. What the Prince offers is seclusion and peace and quiet. We first visited The Wailea Grand and Fairmont for dinner. Nick's at the Fairmont is one of the finest eating experiences we have ever had. We were envious. Then, we visited the Grand, Fairmont, Renaissance, etc... during the day. UGH! CHILDREN $@!#%! They were so crowded on the grounds and around the pool, also felt crowded on the beach. None of that at the Prince--very peaceful and NOT crowded (and apparently they were close to capacity when we were there). If you want amazing pools, you won't like the Prince--it has a clean, simple round pool--rather small. However, who wants a pool when you go to Maui? The beach is around 1/4 mile long. It's a beautiful beach, and here's one of the #1 reasons to choose the Prince--there is a turtle cleaning station right on the rocks on the left side of the beach. It is fabulous--you walk right out and every day can swim along side the giant sea turtles. People from other resorts travel down to the Prince for the experience! The other main reason we loved the Prince was the proximity to the beach. While the other large resorts were set back 100 yards from the beach or more, the Prince is right there. We laughed with other guests about our experience of sleeping with the sliding doors wide open to the sound of crashing waves. Lovely. The biggest downside is probably that the rooms themselves fall somewhere between 3-star and 4-star. If a super luxury room is what you want, you might be dissapointed with the Prince. We cared less about that than the proximity to the beach. Also, the hotel was apparently nearly at capacity when we were there, but it sure felt like there weren't that many people around. There are several very nice restaurants at the Prince. As with all eating out on Maui, it is pricey! It wasn't a problem for us, but there is a louao (bad spelling, sorry) 3 or 4 nights per week. There is one side of the Prince that faces the event--the drums might bother you. However, avoid this problem by reserving a room away from that side of the hotel. The Prince is about a 5 minute drive past all of the other resorts toward the lava field. This results in the wonderful seclusion of the hotel. There is an amazing koi pond and the grounds are wonderfully maintained. If you want to go to the other resorts, the Prince offers complimentary transportation to any of the resorts on Wailea. What else...one of the snorkel services to Molokini leaves right off the Prince beach. The lava fields are about a 15 minute drive away--they will eat your shoes up, so be careful! We rented from Snorkel Bob's--found the equipment to be good at a good prince. We found what we think is the best snorkeling on the island (according to some locals). If you head about 10 minutes from the Prince toward the lava fields, the little road goes around a cove with houses. I think it's called the fishbowl or something like that (the aquarium?). It looks like NOTHING from the road. But when you wade in, you are greeted by hundreds of fish! We preferred this spot to Molokini. If we return to Maui, we will probably return to the Prince. The rooms are a little older and less luxurious than the other 5 star resorts on Wailea. But the seclusion and hearing the waves from your room and the turtles on the beach daily left us feeling completely satisfied with our choice.",

The snorkelling is great and a very good Molokini trip leaves from the hotel every morning. Out of bed and straight into the crater! I had a wonderful time and would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys nature, peace and seclusion.

        "content": "We just returned from a 10 night stay at the Maui Prince Hotel (August 15-25). We were married on the beach right behind the hotel. It was a beautiful beach. Starting with our arrival, everyone was so friendly. Free valet parking is offered which is always a plus. Our room was really nice - we had an ocean view room (room 222). It had a view of the mountain,ocean and it was right over the pool. You could always see the sunset from the balcony. Complimentary goodies and water were provided 2 out of the 10 nights. They provide a little refrigerator in the room - very convienent. Room service is really good as far as the food is concerned but it is quite pricy. Housekeeping did a great job every day and gave us a fresh bucket of ice daily. Exercise room is free to use for people staying at the hotel. And there is a self service laundry room that came in very handy. The pool was a nice size with lots of lounge chairs. They also provided lounge chairs for the beach. There was really not much to complain about ....the sheets were a little bit itchy but fresh. There were very few children staying at our hotel and that was a plus for us because we were on our honeymoon. The luaus held on the hotel grounds can get a little bit loud at times but nothing too annoying. The hotel gardens / grounds are beautiful. The restaurants at the hotel are pricy but very tasty. All in all - Maui Prince was a great choice and especially for the price. We would definitely stay there again.",

        "content": "We've just got back from almost a week in paradise with my wife and son (June 13-19), and even though my wife said that I haven't got a romantic bone in my body, the Prince is a fantastic place for some loving! It's hard not to repeat all the good things that have been said about this hotel, so I can just re-emphasize most of them. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. Fantastic beach, nice pool (so what if it's a bit small?), beautiful setting, wonderful wildlife (birds, turtles, deer) etc. etc. 10/10. We had a very nice room at the lobby level (#154). It opened towards the courtyard in rear of the hotel, where the birds congregate in the trees every morning and evening to socialize. They will probably wake you up the first time you hear them go, but you'll get used to it. If you want a more quiet room then ask for something near the front of the hotel. Of course the Lanai was nice, overlooking the gardens and west Maui in the distance. 9/10. The staff were fantastic - from the bell desk to the reception and especially Leila at the pool: 10/10. Free valet parking is superb! 10/10. Beach activities were great - my son also earned to Scuba dive and I had a refresher dive with the turtles! 9/10 Although the Luau is held in the grounds, there are probably better ones on the island than the one at the prince. The setting is great but the entertainment can be a bit cheesy. The food is only so-so and at $75 it's not cheap. The upside is that you can drink as much as you want and not worry about driving back afterwards! Overall 7/10 for the Luau. Room service is pretty good, considering the prices for food elsewhere in the hotel. I'd recommend stopping at Safeway in Pi'ilani (just off hiway 31) to get some supplies - drinks, salads etc. , then have a picnic on the beach (or in your room!). 8/10 for room service The Friday Seafood & Prime Rib Buffet was very good - it's worth not eating much for the whole day to make sure you have room for everything! More shrimp as well as crab and lobster would give it a higher score than my 8/10. The breakfast buffet is excellent too; it's great sitting outside with all the birds (Mynas, Night Herons etc.) by the Koi pool, and the meal will keep you satisfied the whole day. 10/10. You will need a car if you really want freedom, otherwise you can use the free shuttle to the nearby Wailea resort shops. Our overall score is a good 9.5/10 (it would be 10/10 if the prices were lower, but then that's Maui for you...). We will definitely be back there as soon as possible, even though the island is more expensive than the mainland. Catman",

        "content": "This could have been the perfect beach front hotel. My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights in April 2005. We booked an oceanfront room at just over $500 per night including taxes. We were looking for peace and quiet, service and a great oceanfront location. We got 2 out of 3. While we were there, the hotel was changing the room locks. All day long the whine of the worker's drill could be heard. We did not spend a lot of time in the room during the day, but by the second day, this was very annoying. But even worse, twice while we were in our room *with* the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, the hotel staff knocked on our door because they wanted to change the lock. After it happened the first time, I complained to the assistant manager, but the next day, same thing. To me, this is unacceptable. The second time, the excuse was \"you are the only room left to do on this floor\". Apparently that trumps a Do Not Disturb! Well, you can see where management's priorities are. At $500 per night, this sort of work should not be scheduled when the room is rented to a guest. Not recommended.",

        "content": "I have to be honest, having read mixed reviews (especially the one about the bugs in the beds), I was a little concerned about the Maui Prince. It was the only hotel with availability during the holiday season so we didn't really have a choice on hotels. After having stayed for 7 days, I was very pleased with the hotel. I did not see any bugs and our room was very clean and tastefully decorated. I am sure that it is not as nice as some of the other resorts on Maui, but I was pleased with the property. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, and many other expensive hotels and the Maui Prince met my standards. The grounds were very peaceful and like eveyone else has said, quiet and relaxing. The beach is beautiful and a wonderful place to snorkel. Many of the snorkel boat trips came to the ocean in front of the Maui Prince because it is known as Turtle Town. I saw a ton of turtles, eels, beautiful fish, and coral! I saw more snorkeling off the shore of this hotel than I did on my scuba dive! The food was great at that Hakone but the Prince Court was typical hotel food. The staff were all extremely nice and I have to say, probably nicer than any hotel staff that I have ever dealt with. I am glad that I stayed on that part of the island. It is just beautiful there and less tourist like than other parts of the island. Please know that there is a ton to do and you aren't too far away from everything. The only rude service that we had on the island was at the Kobe Japanese restaurant in Lahaina. Do not go there under any cirumstances. Regarding the Maui Prince, an overall nice place to stay so don't believe some of the bad reviews that it has gotten. I wanted to make sure to post to this site because it really had me concerned and I felt it was necessary to help others going there to feel more at ease with their choice than I did.

        "content": "After spending 5 nights at the Prince Maui, my wife and I were left with the feeling that it could have been so much better with a few simple things being done that other hotels of the same class all seem to manage. When you arrive, I expect a real flower garland not some cheap sea shell made in the phillipines. A glass of something fizzy to welcome you would be nice. A customer relations manager to take your round the hotel on arrival so you know where everything is. We were on a wedding anniversary trip, so some sort of effort would have been nice on the hotels part. Fruit basket, something. I do not expect to have to pay $18 a day to have an umbrella on the beach. Personal attention, even if its something silly like asking if we need our sunglasses cleaning when by the pool.. it does make a difference. The hotel needs a refit, the pool is tiny, the spa is a joke, they need to sort out a proper beach service, cheap and nasty sun loungers don't cut it. After speaking to people on Maui basically allot of things I've mentioned were there once like a proper Maui welcome, but the human resources manager has cut them all out trying to cut costs. Anyone with any brains gets fired, she doesn't want to feel bettered by anyone. So while the head office is happy with the cost cuts the clients leave unimpressed and unhappy. Staff morale is very low, although we found staff friendly. Lots of people have left the hotel. Others are trying to go to the four seasons, which i think is the best hotel on the island at the moment. The idea of the Mau Prince being away from everything is a good one but the hotel isn't upto the job. They should look at other hotels like Legends in Mauritius who do the same but a lot better. In the end over our five night stay we didn't eat once in the hotel restaurants which you may think is a shame but when you see that you are paying an extra for everything, even internet access(!), you don't want to spend anymore in the hotel. So we ate most nights at the four seasons and at Wailea.",

Our children were part of \"the kid's eat free\" package which was great. The flowers and koi pond on the grounds were beautiful. The room service was quick and food prepartation was exceptional. We ate almost all of our meals at the hotel and were never disappointed. The sunday brunch was incredible. The pools are average, but we were not there to stay at the pools all day. The cabana's were free, a bonus, if needed. The beach was the highlight. Expansive and uncrowded, swimming and snorkeling was perfect. Turltes visited every day to the coral reef twenty yards off the beach. The golf course was five stars. We played the south course and the views of the ocean and island were breathtaking. We rented clubs (talyor made r580 driver and RAC irons) and they were almost brand new. I would definitely stay again at the Maui Prince.",

The Prince is the last hotel on the southwest side of Maui, about a 5 - 10 minute drive past the previous hotels, and we just loved the quiet atmosphere, laid back feeling, and privacy of it. We are going back next year, and will definitely stay here again. Spent one night at the Grand Wailaiu, but was way too busy and noisy for us.",

        "content": "It was our first trip to Maui, but not to the Hawaiian Islands. I was nervous about booking a place, so I asked around. Many folks recommended the Napili Kai. As you have read in many reviews on this site, people found the rooms to be outdated. I can only review the room that I stayed in, which was in the building called \"Puna II\". It was totally renovated, with op to date appliances and furniture. Everything was new, and it was quite lovely. We enjoyed our room immensely, and it was cleaned neatly every day we were there. We even made our bed, and each day the maid re-made our bed! LOL. Anyway, it was a great room, #240, which was on the second floor, on the corner of the building. It had an incredible view, and since it was on the corner, we got an extra wide view of the ocean from two fronts. Excellent! We really enjoyed sitting out on the large patio, overlooking the beautiful Pacific. We saw whales and a sea turtle not far out to sea from our patio. The pools are right below, so you can go swimming in relative quiet if you want, instead of going to the Pacific. The lounge chairs were rarely used, and we never had problems finding empty ones. The beach is near enough that it is convenient, and far enough where you don't get the noise from the beach crowd. The beach is gorgeous, and the water is so nice and not too cold. Snorkeling was great, but best when you swam to the right side of the beach (west) and went up around the point. It was great out there. Be careful of the reef in the center of the bay as I nearly got stuck on it. I didn't realize it was so high! We did not try any of the restaurants, as we had stopped at Costco at the airport and bought all of our food to cook ourselves which we greatly enjoyed. The restaurants looked good, and the food looked good, but as always in Hawaii, overpriced. The kitchens in the units are fully stocked with everything you will need, so no need to worry about that. There are barbecues below near the pool for everyone to use also. We loved cooking in our kitchen. One of the more beautiful aspects of this hotel is its location which is so lovely. You can walk west from the hotel and walk nearly two miles, right on the beach, past the Four Seasons and see some marvelous sites on the shore. Also if you walk up two more miles there are some great snorkeling beaches off of the 30 highway. There are hardly any people there too. Worth the walk or drive. The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is that the staff at times seemed unfriendly, like they really didn't like their jobs, or were just in a bad mood. I know it's a job and not many people like their jobs, but you could at least fake it. Especially at the towel cabana, I felt like I was putting them out and \"making them work\", or just annoying them when I asked them to change my towel. Our maid was very friendly however, as was the young lady who checked us in, she was quite personable. Overall, this is a very nice hotel, well worth the price, especially if you stay in the Puna II building. We loved it!",

The only drawbacks are that I wish there was a gas bbq near the Punta bldgs, and I wish there were other places to get your towles besides the beach cabana that was a little bit far from us. I really loved the polynesion feel the place has and will return again as well as reccommend to my friends.",

It is home, it is family, it is everything paradise should be. It is not fancy, it is Hawaiian. Stunning grounds, gracious staff that is there year after year and to say it is relaxing is an understatement. This is the only place I have ever left to return home and cried.

Beach area is nice but it's shared with a host of other hotels, you really can't see that from their web cam, so its pretty packed with little ones playing in water. Forget grabbing a nap in during the day in the summer months. Use the public access beach behind the property which can be accessed via the parking lot. Early mornings and late evenings on the beach are nice as was the ocean view from the room. Had to move rooms, first one was behind the hot tub in the main building and it got loud at night . The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Earlier reviews of their restaurant are correct, quite pricey for what you get.",

        "content": "The Napili Kai has an incredible setting on Napili Bay ... a beach with incredible fun for the family .... body surfing, snorkeling and sea turtles to name a few. Last year we came to stay in Lani 2 and it was a vacation of a lifetime. We came back this year with high expectations but were placed in the Puna Point Buildings. Puna Point has a fabulous, unobstructed ocean view but these units are older, have a musty smell and bug problems. Little ants were all over the counter. There was a pesticide under the counter for us to spray if we wished; however, we didn't really want the residue of the spray on our food so we put up with the ants. We could have asked to change rooms but decided to stay put because of the wonderful view. The staff were professional but not as friendly as I remembered from last year. Housekeeping was hit or miss, depending on which cleaner we got. One was exceptional, the other (in the afternoon) left garbage under the sink and did not appear a happy camper. Overall, we enjoyed our stay but were also ready to move on at the end. Napili is a good location for fun and proximity to lots of excellent sight seeing and activities. The Napili Kai, as we have experienced, has the potential to be excellent. If they renovated the older rooms and upped their level of service, we would definitely want to try it again; however, next time we come back, we will likely try somewhere new.",

The first incident occured when my wife was harrassed on the beach and accused of not being a patron of the hotel by one of the employees working in the Makai Hale because we had not signed up for a beach towel which would have identified as patrons, allowing us to use the resorts chairs on the beach. We had our own towels and chairs were not items signed out for. By the way the verb harrass was used by the employee to describe her behavior, not a description we stamped this individual with. We then asked the employee to find out about the Honeymoon package which we were identified under(we were honeymooners) in hopes of getting the sparkling wine, food certificates....etc... included with this service (as advertised and stated in our itinerary). Upon returning the towel and snorkeling equipment the employee proceeded to tell me she spoke to my wife and the resort would be taking care of this for us. Nothing was ever done and we left the resort with a sour tatse in our mouths.",

Hotel grounds very beautiful. Beach awesome. Oceanview studio, very cozy, spacious no complaints at all. We ate breakfast at the hotel once. Food absolutely delicious, but way overpriced for the portions. The plan was to shop for groceries and prepare our own meals, but we soon realized it would be cheaper to just eat out, after browsing the lanes at the grocery store. A carton of OJ was 6 bucks! The weather was nice. About 80 degrees, with sporadic showers and gusts of wind. The week we were there, the crowd was mostly 50+ (it seemed) and families. If you're looking for a slow paced, quiet type of environment, Napili Kai is it. FYI: I have more pics to show of the room, but they are very large files and I do not feel like shrinking them.

High speed wireless internet is not in the room, but can be accesses in the open air lobby. Unlike the Kapalua Bay, the hotel is RIGHT on the beach and beach is wonderful. (You can walk to the Kapulua Bay Beach in about 4 minutes if you really want to see that beach - but I thought this beach was nicer). I had great snorkeling right there - I even saw a sea turtle! The beach was a little crowded at times and loud with some kids - but still nice. I liked the free iced tea and fruit every morning on the beach. I would go there again in an instant.",

There's basically one road in west Maui, circling the mountains, so it takes four times as long to go east as it would as the crow flies. Almost 2 hrs to Haleakala and I-don't-wanna-know to Hana. Judging by the clientele at the pool, there must have been some sort of tattoo convention in town that week.",

        "content": "My husband and I stayed here for the first half of our honeymoon. We chose to visit Maui because we wanted to end our honeymoon in Napa and we wanted to have the option of adventure if we got bored with laying by the pool. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The bedroom and bathroom were well-maintained and very clean (which is, of course, to be expected at a Ritz). The style is very simple though, so if you're looking for a modern and trendy room, or something over the top with luxury, this is not the hotel for you. While planning our trip, we struggled with staying here or at the Four Seasons in Wailea. We thought the Four Seasons would be a little more decadent and \"at-your-service.\" But when we learned that the Four Seasons shares their beach with the #1 family resort in Maui, we opted for the Ritz to have a more romantic honeymoon. While in Maui, we checked out the Four Seasons, and we were glad with our decision. The Four Seasons is in a \"hotel row,\" and right next to a huge mall (even if it is high-end shopping, I don't want to vacation next to a mall.) We've heard the Four Season's has an adult pool and staff come around with frozen grapes, mist you water, etc etc. The Ritz did not have these services. We were certainly bummed, but it didn't ruin our vacation. We had a wonderful experience at the Ritz spa, that made up for the simplicity of the pool service. We did a couples package and we enjoyed every minute of it. Everything was very clean and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. But, the real shining star was the concierge. We stayed on the club level and had our own concierge- they booked everything for us, gave us tips, maps, and even a CD to play on the Road to Hana that tells you when to stop and explains what you're looking at. They weren't too much help when we wanted to know where to get the best local food, but when we found out from our instructor at Maui Paddle Sports, they were extremely interested in getting a copy of our restaurant list in case anyone else inquired (apparently most people staying at the Ritz don't ask about the best food trucks for a mix plate). All-in-all, we had a vacation mixed with relaxation and adventure, and were very satisfied with our Ritz Carlton, Kapalua pick.",

        "content": "My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 7 nights in November. Even hard-to-please people would have a difficult time complaining about this place, though the location means people who like being in the center of activity should avoid it. Location: The Ritz is located on Kapalua beach, which is about 20 minutes north of Lahaina and 15 minutes north of Kaanapali. It's a touch remote, but is worth it for me as this meant a much quieter vacation. If this are were Las Vegas, Kaanapali would be the strip with reams of people while Kapalua would be a beautiful ranch just outside the city. Service: The only complaint I had in this area was rectified. We had some really slow pool service one day, but when I stood up to flag down the waiter a managerial-type person ran up to me and took care of my order and then attended to those around me who also may have been neglected. Everything else was outstanding. Any questions were asked, and the staff gave me lots of local, inside tips for exploring West Maui. Room: Room was good, but probably if I had to pick a 'low spot' of the trip this would be it. It wasn't very soundproofed as I could hear people chattering in the hall and moving above me. The room had a great patio, but it unfortunately didn't have a light! When the sun goes down at 5:45 this is a must in my opinion. Otherwise the room was great. Nice big TV, great maid service, two free bottles of water everyday. Amenities: The pool here is fantastic. The middle pool is 'adults only', and I did see an attendant kick two kids out of it one day. The beach is extremely close....people who complain about the 'hike' to the beach are absolutely out of their mind. 3 minutes from the Ritz, tops. And it's a beautiful walk over perfectly manicured lawns. The beach itself (DT Fleming) is considered one of the best in Hawaii. It's sheltered so the wind isn't crazy, is nice and calm during low tide for swimming, but perfect during high tide for boogey boarding or surfing. The hotel is also serviced by a Kapalua shuttle, which will take you anywhere in the immediate area for free. This service is also on-demand, which is awesome. Whenever you want it, just speak to a nearby attendant and it will come scoop you up. Ditto for returning, as most of Kapalua seems to service the Ritz. Nearby Services: These were great. Staying at the Ritz is obviously expensive, and eating there only exascrbates this issue. There is a Kapalua 'General Store' about a 5 minute walk away that has a deli, grocery store, and liquor. Given the mini-fridge in the room, you can really make use of this. There's also an excellent Japanese restaurant near the General Store (Sansei), which has quality on-par with the Ritz but prices are about 50% cheaper. Overall this place won me over. It was my first time at the Ritz and certainly won't be my last.",

Specifically, we were comped a VIP cabana at the pool, treated to a wonderful lunch with cocktails and treated with extreme kindness and attentiveness. Specifically I want to mention Kyle, Shannon and Margie who made our experience exceptional. They made their hard work look as if it was effortless and always had smiles on their faces.

We rented cabanas on the days were at the pool a lot ot minimize the wind. The cabanas were $100 a day and came with a cooler of drinks and a tray of fresh pineapple. The swimming pool was pretty chilly, but it didn't seem to bother the kids! Our group did a snorkeling/photography program through the Ritz that was really good. We also enjoyed the lei making class.

        "content": "We went to Maui for the first time and decided to stay at the Ritz Carlton on Kapalua. Location: First and foremost the location is amazing. It's a little isolated from the more developed part of the island and that adds to it's exclusivity. Being surrounded by 4-5 beautiful beaches adds to it's aura. DT Fleming is right on the property and is heavenly. I highly recommend doing the Kapalua trail which is a little beyond the hotel. Service: The concierge service was excellent and prompt. We had one service mishap when on the very first night our room service order had to be given twice and it finally arrived 2 hours after we ordered it. But the food was good and they took it off our bill. Apart from this the service everywhere was superb. Property and Room: We had a partial sea and golf course view and it was beautiful! We could see the island of Molokai across the sea. I even caught a rainbow one morning after the daily morning shower, which is like a regular feature in Kapalua. The room was spacious, clean, well decorated and comfortable. Overall the property is very well developed with a sprawling golf course, spacious pool (though we didn't spend much time there - world class beaches were close by, remember?), tennis courts etc. Food and dining: On site there were quite a few options food. We only sampled the fare at The Terrace - good, solid breakfast/brunch and Banyan Tree - classy and loved the pea soup but not my entrÃ©e so much. But the location and feel at night is very relaxing. Spa: This is probably one of the best spa experiences I've ever had. Good enough for me to forget the 25 minute delay in the beginning. I appreciated the emphasis on relaxing, no rush to throw you out and the facilities available. My favorite - the exclusive, clothing optional hot tub for women which looked as if the room had been cut out of lava rocks. I had an excellent masseuse who was very careful since mine was a prenatal massage. Snorkeling: I wanted to mention my husband'd experience with the City under the Sea snorkelling excursion available by Ritz Carlton. Since this was his first time and he's not the best swimmer around so we wanted a guided service. The excursion was memorable for him. He was the only person taking the excursion that day so it was like a one on one experience. Kevin - the instructor was very knowledgeable and he took us through a presentation about reefs, how they are formed and the dangers facing them along with the wildlife there. He was an excellent guide and took some great pictures for us too. I would like to add that though I didn't go snorkelling I had gone along with them to the beach. He was very attentive especially after knowing that I was pregnant and included me in all the other activities. Environmental Consciousness: We appreciated the hotels efforts towards environmental consciousness and preservation. This was reflected everywhere. From their Ambassadors program to the room service. IMPORTANT WARNING: Please don't follow your GPS while driving from the airport to the hotel. It will take you through the unrecommended, dangerous and very narrow route through 340 via Honokohau. You should take 380 and come via Lahaina. Though the former route is beautiful it gets really treacherous at times and it's okay if you're prepared for it, but not after a 13 hour flight when you think you're in the middle of nowhere. The Ritz should mention this on their website. Overall a truly amazing vacation. I would return anytime!",

There are several fantastic restaurants nearby with a courtesy mini bus running back and forth to take you there and pick you up if you fancy a change from the hotel restaurants (very pricey) The pool is wonderful with plenty of sun beds and it's just a very short ( and pretty) walk down to the most gorgeous beach ever: DT Fleming beach. The beach was never over crowded and the water was gorgeous for a swim. Sometimes it was a bit breezy but it was a warm breeze and we actually welcomed this on warmer days. We got married here and had a perfect day rounded off with a superb meal at the Banyan Tree. Kapalua is breathtakingly beautiful and I honestly can't fault this super hotel. Go there and enjoy!",

Plain white bed linen without decent cover makes a room look unfinished so walking into my room, I was decidedly underwhelmed...after all this is The Ritz!! Bar that one moment, the rest of our stay was magical. We stayed on the club level...best $100 upgrade ever! 5 Meal presentations per day and an open bar...does it get any better than this? The concierge staff are the best. They were warm and friendly and made us feel at home. The Hotel and grounds are spectacular. Pools and jacuzzis were immaculately maintained. A short walk down to a secluded white-sand beach with full service. Everywhere we went we were greeted with a warm ALOHA! I could have spent the entire vacation just there but Maui has so much to offer. The location is a little out of the way which is both good and bad but the buzzing resort town of Lahina is a just short ride away. Alas, I am now back in Memphis. We went from 80F on Saturday to 22F on Sunday. But the memories will sustain me until I return!!",

On check in, they asked if it was our first time in New York (it was) and then gave us a free tourist map and pointed out where the attractions were and the best ways to get to them.The room was very clean and meticulously maintained. A nice touch for a hotel in this price bracket was the bathrobes that were provided. The only thing to note about the room was that the bed was a standard double (not too much of an issue for my wife and I as we're quite slim people) but that might not be acceptable for everyone. Ricks cafe was great for a self service breakfast. Snacks and Coffee were available all day and there is complimentary wine and cheese in the evening.Saving the best until last, the location of the Casablanca is fantastic. Just steps away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square, but on a quieter street that doesn't appear to be used as a main thoroughfare.We'll be back.",

We had a mini suite which was fabulous.There is nothing negative to say about this hotel.

        "content": "Superb customer service As I expected, after reading the unbelievably glowing reports of the Casablanca - the concierge service and general friendliness of the staff was absolutely excellent. The only reason I haven't given the hotel the same kind of review is because of a few minor things, but none of them serious.Yes, the complimentary breakfast is really useful, but after 7 days it was a bit samey - but remember, this is FREE!! so no real complaints there.We didn't really make use of the free cheese and wine as we were out virtually all day and into the night, but I did use it on our first night and was stunned at the quality of the wine and cheese available - shame it didn't start sooner and end later as we would have used it every day. If you're the sort of tourist who likes a 9-5 day with an evening out after getting changed, then this is ideal for you.We were in the hotel over Thanksgiving, so it was pretty packed but we never had a problem getting a table at Rick's cafe. Noise - didn't affect us at all, all you need to do is ask for a quiet room, we were on the sixth floor. In fact I was absolutely amazed at how quiet the hotel was considering that THE noisiest and busiest place in the world - Times Square is literally 30 yards away!Our toilet got blocked too (is this a hotel plumbing problem?), but there was no problem getting it unblocked. I was surprised to hear that another reviewer met an unhelpful member of staff, as everyone we met was superb. Considering some of the ridiculous requests we heard in the breakfast area from some of the guests, I'm amazed that the staff were so courteous. I sometimes wonder why people go on holiday at all if they only like things done in a certain way.Yes, the room was small but we weren't really in the room for long enough periods for this to be a problem. Towels changed every day as were the toiletries.We also received a free bottle of champagne, as it was our wedding anniversary - this seems to be standard practice now for decent hotels if you mention a special celebration. I just hope people don't start abusing this and make up a birthday just to get a free bottle of bubbly.Overall, our stay at the Casablanca was brilliant and I have no hesitation in recommending it - but don't go there if you like faceless corporate hotels.",

Have stayed in the likes of the Plaza on 5th ave before and have to say that i found this hotel the best of the lot. I can not recommend this place enough. the friendliest staff you will ever find anywhere. The hotel itself is very clean. I though the room was a fine size considering what i have read. the bathroom was also fine. Only problem was I would have liked it to have air con as when opening the window the smell from the Italian next door was not to pleasant. Rik's cafe was fantastic. Great breakfast and great wine! When we checked out i couldn't believe it when we were told to make full use of the cafe until we had to get the flight. We were also told that if we had a late flight the make sure we came back for the wine and cheese later, even though we were checked out! They were truly amazing. Cant fault anything, location, cleanliness, friendliness, food, everything was great. Try Tony's next door for the best Italian food ever (and apple martinis!) Jimmy's Cornor around the block is an experience. A dive but a fantastic dive! Owned by a professional boxer who serves behind the bar this place has so much atmosphere. Want to meet true New Yorkers well here is the place to go. Also try St. Andrews 2 doors up.",

The added bonus was that our room overlooked an internal courtyard, which although did not give much of a view, meant that it was completely quiet at night time - even in the city that never sleeps.

I slept like a baby. Usually in a hotel I am up all night uncomfortable... not here. Although if asked again I might not choose a room on a low floor overlooking the pool like we had... It was a little loud when the band was playing. Also, having such a low floor(4th) made me feel as if we were at the pool when I looked out. But we were on the floor with the SPA. I had a massage, facial and a manicure. It was a great experience. I have been to many spas. The technicians for my services were top notch. Unfortunately the relaxation area with the HOT tub could have been updated.",

        "content": "We stayed at Harrahs from 8/17 to 8/22. We had purchased roundtrip shuttle services so they dropped us off at Harrahs about 10:30am. We waited about 5 minutes in the check-in line; however, our room was not ready. Was told guests ocuppying had not checked out. So we left our luggage with luggage services and check out the areas. At about 1:30pm, we checked back in to see if our room was ready - it wasn't. They had another room in the Carnival Tower that was 2 queen beds that were available so we took it since we wanted to check-in and put our stuff away; besides, the King bed wasn't important (this is what we had reserved). Ours was a non-smoking room on the 7th floor. I thought the room was decent given the price we paid. Everything worked - we had no problem with it. We spent most of our time out and about so the only time we were in the room was to sleep. As most say - you get what you pay for. There was some noise (like a woodpecker pecking) but when we called the front desk we were told that it was due to construction and that we shouldn't hear it during bedtime. True to their words. Our room was a reasonale walk to the casino floor. We thought the location was a good place on the strip. We checked out all of the hotels on the strip during our stay. Looking back, I didn't think the Harrahs was smokier (meaning a lot of smoke floating around) than most. I think what it was is that it has a heavy smoke smell due to poor ventilation, perhaps? Outside of that it is the same as most other hotels. We thought their buffet was OK - we had coupons so that helped with cost. We at their Cafe' restaurtant and I thought for the price we had paid for 2 breakfast entrees - we would've found more value at the buffet but couldn't go there because it was after breakfast hours and we wanted breakfast. We also ate at Ming's Table - didn't like it so much. They have express check-out service via using menu on the TV. Based on others' reviews of the long lines, we took advantage of this feature and used the Express check-out. We didn't use any services while we stayed there nor touch the bar fridge so our account was '0' which made the Express check-out much easier. We then left our luggage with luggage services and $@!#% 2 hours inside the casino until our shuttle pick-up services arrived. For the most part, we were comfortable with our stay at Harrahs.",

        "content": "Stayed at Harrah's for the first time during a recent trip where I divided the time between Mirage and Harrah's. I have always wanted to stay there. (Never go to a lesser hotel directly after an awesome one FYI...lol) I was staying on a comp but still had to come up with 100.00 per night for \"incidentals\" which I think is ridiculous on a comp but whatever...it just made things get started wrong... The walk to the room was quick and easy. We were in the Mardi Gras tower. I like the Harrah's breakfast buffet and did like the fact that my players card was also a line pass so we did not have a long wait. But with that being said..we already knew we liked it . Might not have chosen it if I was judging it by the front desk folks. The room was small and worn and cramped feeling. It was clean enough but just seemed a little dank or something. It was supposed to be an upgraded room but I really don't know. It seemed a little dumpy to be the upgraded version? I know , I know, you hardly see your room...but I want a place to put my stuff! No closet just a Chiffarobe. Most storage space was taken up by the refrigerators of over priced goodies. Had to lay my phone on the floor by the outlet to charge! The casino folks were friendly. The casino itsef was a little and a bit widy curvey and tight old but I enjoyed it. The walk to access tbe strip was simple except for when you were going thru all the vendors. The Valet parking was a little slow and getting into the valet parking from the strip is a Full On Nightmare... Like I said the place is okay but I won't go back and stay there. I will find another Harrah's property. I actually like IP much better as far as the room is concerned.",

I had a comped room this time and did not ask for an upgrade or view. We were on the 6th floor of the Mardi Gras Tower. Very quiet and a short distance from the elevator. Beds had good linen and were very comfortable. I spent one day at the pool. Quiet and relaxing, no loud music that day anyway. An older crowd. A few young people but no kids. I ordered lunch there..food was good and reasonably priced. Drink service was good also. There were cabanas but none were in use that day. Drink service was good in the casino anytime of the day or night. Overall a good midpriced hotel right in the centre of the strip.",

I recently checked in at Harrah's while on a get-away trip with friends. When I got to the desk the girl was the most rude person I've experienced in a long while. McDonald's drive-thru staff have better customer service skills. I looked at the other checking in guests and they all seemed to be equally as miserable but the one I had won the prize. Since she couldn't handle the check in, 'Alame' didn't get anything right with the rooms. During the process with her perceived problems she went to a supervisor for assistance who seemed to just as unhappy with his job as she was. So, the check-in was terrible, the rooms were not right, and the rudeness of this person set the tone for the rest of my stay.",

        "content": "The title says it all. We arrived late (around 10pm) but even then had to wait half an hour to check in. When we finally got to a receptionist she advised that we had been upgraded. Having reserved a room with a king bed or 2 queens we werent quite sure what to expect. However, when we got to our room we discovered we had been allocated a dreadful room. It had a really odd layout; the lounge area was bigger than the sleeping area and the two were separated with a wall which blocked out most of the light from the one small window. To add insult to injury the bed was a standard double and they had left a pull out bed in the lounge area. We asked for the pull out to be moved immediately as it took up so much space and it was still there an hour later - when we called down to again we were told it would be in the next hour - this was at 11.35pm so we told them the next five minutes or not to bother - we were just on the point of moving it into the corridor ourselves some 20 minutes later when someone finally came to take it away. To top it all off we were right next to the lift shaft and, being Vegas, we could hear the lifts all night. We had gone straight downstairs to complain when we were first shown the room but received a none to helpful or friendly response - the long & short of it being they were full so we could put up and shut up and try again the next morning to see if we could be moved. When we asked what was \"upgrade\" about that particular room we were told it was the view. Our view from our less than big window was the car park. The following morning we went downstairs at 10pm to see if there was another room available (on the way we could see just how awful our room was compared to others which were much more spacious, had king or 2 queen beds and big picture windows) and were told this would be possible but that they could not give us the room number until 12 noon. We were only in Vegas for 4 days and frankly did not want to spend half a day waiting around in the hotel but seemingly had little choice so we went to the pool area. The staff there were just as indifferent to their guests and made no show of hiding their boredom. There was nothing attractive about the pool area - all flat hard concrete with nothing to soften the edges (no planting nothing, just sunbeds and the pool and very little shade with only a few umbrellas). On top of this they had R & B blaring from the speakers situated all around the pool - this was so loud that it drowned out my ipod. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and after 15 minutes i went down to research alternative accommodation on the internet. When we went to check out 1/2 an hour later the reception made it clear that they really couldnt have cared less. I've since written to the hotel to complain and not even received a response. The only plus point? The door staff - they were totally charming and polite - a complete contrast to the reception staff who really couldnt give a damn - they could certainly learn a few lessons from them. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.",

This is an amazing deal! Furthermore, we ate at the \"Top of the world restaurant\" which was an amazing experience!! We loved, loved the view over the whole city and the food was great! The service was brilliant and the staff very friendly!! If you stay at the Stratosphere don't miss the restaurant and the bar on top of the tower! Try to make reservations, it can get really crowded, especially on the weekends. We really liked the pool, it offers sunbeds and also towels for the guests. Even if not located in the middle of the strip, Stratosphere is a really nice location to spend your Vegas expirience. Why not saving a little money on accomodation and spend the saved money on gambling or nightlife? Stay at the Stratosphere, it's a great place!",

The buffet while good value at $24.99 a day has gone down in quality and variety. It was amongst the best previously in my opinion. Our room upgrade never materialised and the one we received was very drab and dark and ill equipped compared to previous visits. The comps and cash backs have significantly reduced. The slots were much tighter. The staff were very helpful friendly and polite. Its position is now compromised having become a sleazy area at night and appreciably away from the main strip attractions. Very good value for money however and its acceptable for a short stay. Free gaming lessons in the morning and cheap tournament places always available.

        "content": "I discovered Dolphin Motel last year while taking a walk on Scott street during my annual trip to San Diego. This year I decided to try it and I realized that I should have tried it before. My first impression while checking in is the nice welcome from Tom at the front desk. All the staff here are very polite and always do their best to accommodate the guests. Mr Murdock, the owner, asked me if all was correct with my room and kindly gave me advices and tips to make my trip to San Diego more pleasant. The rooms are small but very clean and well kept with a big flat-screen TV, a fridge and air-conditioned. The beds and pillows are comfortable. This motel is also well located, close to the airport and easily accessible by public transport buses. The free breakfast served from 6 to 10 AM includes fresh coffee, tea, muffins, bananas, yogurt and orange juice. Stayed from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1, 2011 and I will certainly return next year.",

The bargain she found for us was $160 per night in a decent hotel near Seaworld. As all we were looking for was a clean, safe place to crash for the night, I decided to do a little search of my own and I am glad I did. I stumbled upon this hidden gem on tripadvisor. This quiet little motel cost us less than half of my travel agent's bargain. The rooms were clean and the customer service impeccable. I highly recommend this place and I myself will stay there without second thought.",

Free use of a laptop with WiFi connection was also an added unexpected bonus. Doubt you'll find better value for money in the area.

        "content": "We have visited SD twice before, staying at the Homewood Suites in Del Mar and Motel 6 respectively. This time we wanted to try a location in Point Loma for a number of good reasons. After considering several options (most of the Pt. Loma properties are clustered close together) we opted to try the Dolphin based mainly on price and TripAdvisor reviews. We drove in after dark on I-8 and turned onto Nimitz Ave. at the end of the freeway which brought us right to the Dolphin. Our reservation was accepted and we checked in without problem. Our room was on the second floor which was fine. On first impression we were a bit surprised at the compactness of the room which reminded me of some I had stayed in throughout the UK. Apart from that the room was clean to an acceptable standard and everything that was in it worked accordingly. The place has a kind of '70's feel to it which we have experienced at other SoCal accomodations! We found that the Dolphin was a combination of several pluses and a couple of minuses. The pluses included being situated in Pt. Loma which is a self contained community with most amenities within easy walking distance of the Dolphin. There is a great selection of restaurants, C stores, laundromat, gas stations etc. nearby and the streets are safe to walk after dark. In many ways it resembles most large towns that you would find on the Great Plains with that same \"Howdy neighbour\" friendliness. Pt. Loma is also strategically located in SD to provide quick access to all of the local attractions. We found that having wi-fi was a great convenience as we packed the laptop along. Morning coffee,OJ, and muffins are served in the outdoor courtyard which is very nice on warm sunny mornings. As many other commenters have mentioned the staff and management are very nice folks. The minuses were few and rather petty. The hotel doesn't have a pool (one is located beside the office but belongs to the neighbouring Comfort Inn.) The hotel advertises itself as being on a quiet street (Garrison) which is technically correct, however it is sandwiched between two very busy streets (Rosecrans and Scott). My wife likes to sleep with the windows open and the early morning traffic was very noticeable. The street traffic can be overcome by closing the windows and turning on the circulating fan. Another irritant was the vibrating roar of fighter jets taking off from North Island late in the evening. The snug rooms are fine for sleeping but don't expect to entertain guests. Overall we were quite satisfied with our stay at the Dolphin and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to San Diego.",

The rooms are clean & up to date (if a bit on the small side; not a problem for most recreational visitors in New York). The AC was awesome; we like a cold room at night and NYC temperatures were over 100 degrees F during our stay. Wifi was free and problem free. One thing Doubletree does well is offer free breakfast (which was quite good). They will even let you forgo the buffet and cook an omelet for you. More important to me, as an early riser, they provided free coffee (upon request & with a voucher) in to-go cups so I could read the (free!) paper in the comfort of my room. Why is it that mid-priced hotels provided these nice perks but higher-line properties (at least in NYC) force me to search for coffee and paper every morning? Go figure. The immediate neighborhood left a little to be desired. There was a homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk next door to the hotel and 29th St. is a little dark at night, with little foot traffic.This left my wife feeling a little uneasy, however we were with another couple and did not feel threatened (safety in numbers). We spend 2 or 3 weekends per year in the city and I prefer neigborhoods with more activity in them, from both an entertainment and security point of view. Access to subways is OK, however East side subway service generally means more transfers to other parts of the city. We used cabs more that we usually do.",

This hotel has a 5 star price but it is a low to average 4 star property. There are other hotels in the same area that I would check out first before opting for Ocean Key. That being said, our suite was very nice with a great view of the ocean and Mallory Square. However, unless you get a room on the 5th floor your views of Mallory Square and the Ocean are likely to be obstructed by the ever growing palm trees. The bedroom had small non flat screen television not consistent with a 4 star property at 500 bucks a night. We did hear our neighbors from time to time. I think the walls could use some sound proofing. The staff, all young people under 30 were very helpful. The Hot Tin Roof, the hotel restaurant was outstanding. The Sunset Pier and Bar, also part of the hotel is a fantastic place with terrific live music. No question, you are in the center of the action at Ocean Key, I just didn't think it was worth the $2,200 for the 4 night we stayed there. There are other nice hotels nearby which have lower rates and which would still allow you to visit Mallory Square, view the ocean, hoist a view beers at the Sunset Pier and dine at the Hot Tin Roof.",

        "content": "Palace exceeded expectations! I recently stayed at the New York Palace for 5 nights during a shopping trip to NY with my daughter. We booked one of the newly renovated executive rooms with access to the executive club. On arrival the lobby was rather busy as it was for most of the duration of our stay but we were checked in almost immediately. We were allocated a room on the 31st floor with a terrific view of the cathedral and the city. The room was also bigger then we expected (especially by NY standards) but the bathroom was really quite small, and in my opinion not big enough for two people to share (for example there was only one sink, for a hotel of this calibre I would expect twin sinks). However, I would just point out that when the hotel says 'renovated' rooms I think they mean they have just installed new carpets and wall paper, as the furniture, linen, curtains etc. did not look too new, although overall the room was in very good condition. The beds were very comfortable and the room clean, however, on the second day we noticed a slight problem with out room in that certain areas of it had a slight smell if sick. We contacted reception making them aware of out problem and they were very apologetic and rather embarrassed at the problem and promptly moved us to a room on the 33rd floor with the same view. We only ever visited the executive club for breakfast so didn't really take full advantage of it, but the breakfast was superb and we made sure that when we did eat there we ate in large volumes! But if you plan on eating most of your meals in the hotel I agree with other reviewers that executive club access would be great value.The staff are very attentive and arrived almost immediately if we phoned to request something to our room, and made sure that all our needs (e.g. alternative bedding due to allergy to feathers) were taken care of. The concierges and doormen seemed helpful but were often very busy and I think it would probably be better if there were a few more of them around.The hotels location is just perfect for shopping, and apparently it is good for sight-seeing as well, but with so much shopping to be done we had more pressing activities to be completed.Overall, our stay at the Palace was great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to New York- We're looking forward to hopefully returning next year!",

        "content": "We stayed 4 nights in the Harbour Grand hotel on Hong Kong island at Easter 2012. We had a pleasant stay. It's a pricy hotel, but you get value for it. We are airline staff and they do give industry discounted prices for a room. Just write to the hotel and ask for it. The location: from the metro station Fortress Hill, it's a 5 minutes walk. The hotel is a bit hidden, but it's right on the boulevard. This boulevard is currently (april) under construction and there's a highway between the boulevard and the hotel. It would be a good idea to build a bridge or so over the highway for easy access, but I'm sure something like this should be part of the reconstruction plan already. We can't tell about the kitchen, as we didn't use it. There's many cheap breakfast options in the surrounding streets, which is a good option to save some money here. We used the bar on the top floor though. It is recommended to have at least one drink here at night to enjoy the spectacular view over Hong Kong harbour. The room is luxury, with good beds and a good bathroom. Be sure to book a room with harbour view on the higher floors! At night you can enjoy the wonderful Hong Kong light show from your own room. The only slightly disappointing issue was the pool... The reason why we chose this hotel out of many options was the pool, to be able to relax a little bit after a long touristic day in Hong Kong. But the water temperature was only 21 degr C.... Not inviting to stay in for longer than 5-10 minutes, despite the nice setting. That is too cold for a pool in a 5* star hotel, I would recommend to heat up the pool to a 27 degr C temperature year-round. Luckily they have a sauna and steam bath as well, so you can warm up afterwards. Overal: we had a nice stay here, but there are many good options in Hong Kong. We might try out another hotel next time :-) Wendy and Paul, the Netherlands",

Club room on 38th floor was well equipped (compact but sufficient) clean, well furnished and had all the things you could/would need plus a great view! The club lounge on the 41st floor was just great. Breakfast, tea and coffee all day, afternoon tea and alcoholic drinks 6-8pm and 5pm late check out on departure all included, all for approx. £60 extra per room, per night. Incredible value. Don't listen to reviews about the supposedly dodgy area, it is fine and a taxi in Central Hong Kong only costs about £4 so hardly an expensive ride! Alternatively there is the MTR close by which we didn't use as taxis were so cheap/accessible. Excellent gym, shame about the pool being out of action but to be honest there is so much to do in Hong Kong why would you sit by a pool!? All in all a fantastic hotel which I would not hesitate to use again. I have stayed at the Marriott right in the centre of Hong Kong and didn't find the Harbour Grand in any way inferior for being a few minutes further out.",

The street was a little off-putting as it is very \"local\" with garages and shops, the hotel look a little out of place as the reception is very luxourious. My in-laws stayed here in October 2011 and said how lovely it was so we decided to book it! So glad we did I would say after stopping in this hotel, we will definately be back! Upgraded to the Club lounge and the views from our room across the harbour were lovely. Club lounge is well worth the extra, daily breakfast, free drinks throughout the day, lunch time and evening nibbles and a fantastic view. Staff were lovely, always remember you and very friendly and helpful. Rooms nice and clean. Staff were sometimes a little slow at breakfast but we didnt let it bother us, just felt a bit bad asking! Close proximity to the MTR and we didnt feel at all intimidated by the locals around us, even late at night (as no-one seems to sleep here!) Didnt eat in the restaurant as we wanted to explore as we were only here a short while and the MTR makes it so easy to get around but the in-laws said it was very nice when they came. Looking forward to returning next year!",

I hate to think what our original room would have been like, as with two suitcases and handbaggage there wasn't an awful lot of spare room. The harbour view was only partial, and there was quite a lot of building work going on below us. Fortunately most of our stay was over Chinese New Year so it didn't cause us much bother, but you really noticed it on the last day when everybody was back at work. If you are spending time on Hong Kong Island this hotel has easy access to the MTR which made getting about fairly easy, even though several stops away from Central. Room and harbour views nowhere near as good as the Harbour Grand Kowloon, which we stayed at last time we were in Hong Kong, but more than made up for with its easy access to the MTR without the need of a shuttle bus.",

This hotel in my opinion is basically a convention hotel. The staff were very friendly and the service was good. One thing you should know is the location of this hotel is very bad. It is located in an old 1960's residential neighborhood. There is plenty of local food around but it is not really a tourist area. The hotel is located on a road called \"Oil Can Road\" which is appropriate considering there are car repair shops located next to the hotel. These shops stay open late. The MTR is located about 3 blocks away. If you are coming as a tourist I would not recommend this hotel because you have to hop on the MTR to go anywhere.",

        "content": "Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. I would say this is a good 4 star hotel. I am hesitant to say this is a 5 star hotel because although it looks like a 5 star hotel, it did not feel like a heavy weight 5 star hotel. There were quick free shuttle buses to/from the HK station of the Airport express trains. Service was good but erratic. For example, I ordered the standard Yang Chow Fried Rice for room service. It was way too greasy…can you imagine fried rice with an inch thick of oil at the bottom of the rice? Not exaggerating….after leaving the unfinished rice outside the room for pick up and having written negative comments about it on the napkin, although the item “Private Dining – Room” was reflected on the bill, the cost (without me asking for it) was zero. Great initiative. What was erratic was the newspaper….firstly, they did not ask me whether I preferred English or Chinese papers. Secondly, it was only delivered on the 1st day and they forgot about it for the next 4 days! Finally, there was window cleaning/replacement going on so the ropes from the gondola were constantly knocking against the room’s windows (even late at night). This was not mentioned upon check-in. So although a room change was offered after I inquired about what was going on, it was rather late because I have unpacked and it was late at night. What gave it a 5 star look: a big sized lobby; there was also a musician playing harp in the lobby in evenings…soothing; good sized restaurant for breakfast , did not feel crammed. Nice looking hotel pool too overlooking the harbor. There was a good Business Centre too but a pity that the person behind the counter did not even know how to arrange for a DHL package to be picked up. Why it did not feel like a heavy weight 5 star hotel: weird location. The surroundings are rather run down with no trendy shops to speak off however there is a 7-11, 2 supermarkets and MTR station (Fortress Hill) is a short walk away though. It is not conveniently located i.e. From Fortress Hill. It is a few MTR stops to Admiralty (which you will need to get off in order to get to change MTR to Tsim Tsa Tsui). Suggestion: get the free shuttle buses from the hotel if it takes you to where you want to go (they go to Causeway Bay, Admiralty, Central). Slow elevators in Hotel. Made worse by large tour groups jostling for the elevators. If not too much more expensive, suggest getting a room from 28/F upwards. You will get to use elevators in a different elevator bank from those that tour groups use (they appear to generally use rooms up to 27/F). If you are after good sized rooms (by HK standards), want to feel comfortable in a large hotel with modern amenities, are not bothered too much by its location and its surroundings, and can live with service that does not go the extra mile, and cost is important (it is slightly cheaper than others more conveniently located hotels in the same class) I would say this is a good choice.",

        "content": "I had always wanted to visit HK and pushed the boat out for our Silver Wedding. Like others we opted to upgrade to the Club Room and found ourselves on the 39th floor. The views alone are worth the extra cost. Be sure and ask for a west facing room as you get the aspect out to Hong Kong centre and Kowloon. From the lounge the views are fantastic both during the day and evening when you have front row seats to the lights show at 8.00pm. The staff in the lounge make a real effort to look after you. A real 5 star experience. We found the best way to get around during the day was the metro/underground using Fortress Hill which is only 3 stops from central. I have never felt so safe on an underground system as I did there. We did also go on Star Ferry, buses, taxis and trams as well. On speaking to other tourists on a trip to the Buddha we realised that the compromise of very central v views was worth paying as others didn't have any view out of their hotel due to the built up area nature of the City. The open top bus tour was also an excellent way to find out about HK. We also went to see the Pandas at Ocean Park Theme Park and went on the cable car ride which gave great views over Aberdeen, Stanley and Repulse Bay. The night market in Kowloon was well worth a visit giving you a chance to experience the \"in your face\" Hong Kong. Once again 20/25 minutes back on the metro. Don't bother with the airport transfer which takes around 70 minutes as you are last hotel on the stop, get a taxi as it costs around the same 350HK$ or take the train and then taxi. Always write down where you are going as sometimes the taxi drivers can't understand what you are saying.",

The hotel isn't amongst all of the hustle and bustle at Central, Causeway Bay or Wan Chai, however it is a 5 minute walk from the Fortress Hill MTR Station (which is quick, cheap and frequent enough to commute to Hong Kong's major districts with minimal fuss every day) and there are some nice street markets just up the road. I stayed here for a week over New Years and found it to be a great location. Although there isn't a major shopping district around the hotel, there are still the essentials: Mannings, Wellcome supermarket, 7-11, McDonalds (with McCafe - good value coffee in Hong Kong!) and a Starbucks so you will never be without food nor caffeine. I found the Harbour Grand to be significantly cheaper and more spacious than other hotels that are closer to Central and Causeway bay.

First impression driving in: This CAN'T be it! It's a motel and looks like something you would find in the middle of nowwhere on a road trip. We were led into a dressing room of sorts and told to disrobe, put our personal belongs into a mesh hanging bag and put on a robe. The robes were a joke and did not appear to have been washed. We then had to drag our stuff in the hanging bag into the mud room. While the mud bath felt good, it was hard not to think about how many others I was bathing with if you know what I mean. We were then ushered into another room with our hanging bag for a blanket wrap where an old wool type blanket was thrown over us. When that was over, rather than just keeping us in the same where we've been relaxing, we are then led to another room, still dragging our stuff around, into the massage room. Apparently 2 out of 2 us got good massages while the other two recieved the worst massage we've ever had. Both of us were asked what our trouble spots were by the masseuse, who then completely disregarded what we said. I told my masseuse to feel free to \"dig in\" and I was told that was not the kind of massage she was giving me, that what I was getting is for people who are paralyzed, stroke victims, etc. What???!! The place was dark & dingy, appeared unclean and the $388 per couple + tips could have been better spent at a real spa and resort. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.",

        "content": "Hubby and I went for a couples spa package last weekend for my 40th bday last weekend. What fun! My husband was really worried about the mud bath (he's a clean freak), but even he found it relaxing, comfortable, and fun. I would do the mud bath again - I think he is fine having done it ONCE in his life. I wasn't sure what to expect, having heard tales from others of attendants shoveling hot mud over you while you lay in the mud, and then being sprayed w/power hoses to get the mud off. Nothing could be further from the truth! The attendant tells you what to do, and then leaves you to get in/out of the mud while she's out of the room. She puts cool towels on your forehead, applies a soothing face mask, and explains what the mud is all about and answers questions. After around 15 min in the mud, she returns to tell you to get out, rinse off (there's a curtained-off area, with 2 showers - one for each of you, with a stone bench to sit on if you like) and then you hop in to the jacuzzi, where you relax while drinking cool lemon water. From there, go to the cool-down room, where you're swaddled like a baby in a room with candles, a gurgling water feature, and new age music (which I would normally hate, but didn't mind becuase I was so relaxed). We had 30 minute massages, which were fabulous! I recommend Marcia - who massaged my husband. I think he got a better treatment than I did... though I was happy w/my masseuse (forgot name). We were given a mesh bag to keep our clothes/shoes clean/dry, and $@!#%-flops to walk around in. This seems contrary to what a previous poster mentioned. Golden Haven isn't the top of the line place, but for $108 each (check out online coupons), the 90 minute experience was a great value and a completely fun, relaxing experience. I want to return w/a friend or two. NOTE - don't go winetasting first - we were so glad we hadn't done so! All the heat of the mud and jacuzzi is dehydrating and would be uncomfortable if you had been drinking.",

        "content": "We travelled to Golden Haven filled with trepidation, having read unfair reports in the trip advisor. I fell off my bicycle and broke my hip and was craving healing waters and mineral mud,so we decided to take a jacuzzi room and enjoy the waters come what may. We were delighted to find a pleasant room, spotlessly clean and equipped with small fridge, bottled water, tea, coffee and candy and plentiful fluffy towels and wash cloths. The room was remarkably quiet, tucked away from the main drag, with leafy trees. The staff were very pleasant and the spa facilities excellent. Yes, it's a motel, but you're not paying \"Four seasons\" prices. Especially in the off season, I think we had excellent value for money and the person who mentioned the smell must be unaccustomed to natural sulphur smells from all mineral springs. In fact, I was hardly aware of it, maybe because we took a perfumed candle. So, if you want a reasonably priced, clean, quiet spa experience and you're not a snob, go for Golden Haven. J.C.",

We had a romantic evening in our room which had a huge jacuzzi tub filled with mineral water and fragrant bath salts. We enjoyed breakfast and shopping in the quaint town of Calistoga the next day and then were treated to a fabulously relaxing massage and facial. The staff was wonderful and attentive and I ended the weekend with a totally rejuvenated body and renewed spirit and soul. It is a lovely way to get away from it all...there is an outdoor pool and spa, sunbathing, areas for quiet picnics or group gatherings. I highly recommend a visit.",

        "content": "My husband and I found Golden Haven on the Internet and didn't know anyone who had been to this spa so we had our fingers crossed that our 10th anniversary trip to the Napa Valley would pair well with our stay at Golden Haven. It's a little off the main street and we thought we'd taken wrong turn at first, but from the moment of check-in until we left, it was a completely relaxing, self-indulgent experience that we hope to repeat this summer. We stayed in the jacuzzi room and it was wonderful to soak right before going to bed and first thing in the morning. We had signed up for the couples mud bath and giggled like kids when we were left alone to wriggle down into the mud. It was heaven! We both dozed off (easy after a day of visiting wineries) but the hot spring fed mud bath was extremely relaxing and hot enough for my \"make me sweat\" husband who figured out how to move around to increase the temperature around him. I like a little cooler than he does so I simply didn't move and found the temperature of the mud to be perfect. We washed off, soaked in the jacuzzi and headed for our heated blanked wrap (nap time again) and then an hour long-massage. We had plans of going out for dinner afterwards, but felt so great that we went back to our room and stayed there for the rest of the night. The facilities were clean, the people were friendly and we saw several relaxed, happy people walking around the spa. We highly recommend Golden Haven for your next visit to the area.",

        "content": "We had a TERRIBLE experience at this spa. Admittedly we were 10 minutes late for our appointment for a couples mud bath and massage, but we did not feel the treatment we received was called for. The reception staff were unfriendly and unprofessional. They acted as if they were exasperated and seem inconvenienced at having to wait on us. We felt exteremly unwelcome. We had signed up for an hour mud bath and an hour massage at a promotional rate. Because we were 10 minutes late, our massage time had to be cut in half. Thankfully, we were charged a pro-rated promotional rate. However, the relatively inexpensive price was no consolation for very poor service. In fact, after the entire experience we still felt as though we had been \"ripped off.\" We did not know what to expect with the mud bath, as it was our first experience. This part of our spa treatment seemed very rushed. Our attendant seemed somewhat friendly, but seemed to push us through each of the stages of the mud bath, mineral soak and blanket wrap as though we were in a race. The actual soak time in the mud was about 10 minutes, which we heard, after some research, is probably the shortest soak time alloted amongst all the other spas in Calistoga. During the blanket wrap, we were supposed to retire or even nap in relaxing silence. And despite a sign posted right outside the room requesting quiet, we heard loud laughing and talking the whole time, which made it extremely difficult to fall asleep let alone relax. Our half hour massage was probably the best part of our experience, although that is not saying much. The massage therapists greeted us and bid us farewell very hastily. However, the massage was fairly good, but definitely not near the best we've had. (Perahps we are a bit biased in this opinion because we were already pretty upset by this point.) Overall, we had a very disappointing experience, especially since we had been looking forward to it for a while. We both felt a lot LESS relaxed coming out of the spa than we did going in! We kept joking that what we needed now was a massage since we felt a bit stressed! We would definitely not recommend this spa to anyone. It is much more worth your while to pay a little extra to get much better service. After our very disheartening experience, we went shopping around at several other spas in Calistoga. It seemed like common knowledge among the locals that Golden Haven has a reputation for providing rushed, unfriendly service and for \"herding\" their large numbers of customers through their spa experiences. In some cases, all we had to mention was that we had an extremely poor spa experience and people guessed exactly where we were talking about. That is pretty bad! If friendly, welcoming, accomodating service is essential to you to have a good experience, please do not waste your time here! In spite of the many positive reviews this spa has received, we definitely encourage you to shop around and get a feel for what the locals' opinions are. We think that you will find that every spa will recommend itself, but the good spas will also have some recommendations for other good spas in the area and will have a strong opinion as to where NOT to go, which will be.......take a guess!!! We hope you have a better experience than ours wherever you decide to go!",

        "content": "Pros, Cons  My husband  I just returned from a weekend at Club Med Punta Cana. It was our first Club Med experience.Pros: The weather was wonderful, the beach excellent. Water in the Carribean in Jan is not warm, but it is ok, once you get used to it. The bread in the restaurants was excellent, you have to try the chocolate bread!Neutrals: The food was tolerable. I do not eat seafood, and that is a big problem at Club med. They even put tuna on their pizzas! Yes, they always had beef or chicken, but it was not what you would find in an average american restaurant. There was an abundance of fruit at every meal, which I ate  had no problem with. I also drank a lot of sodas with ice from the bars and had no problem with the water. We did not take our teenagers with us, but they would have been unhappy with the menus. The hotdogs  hamburgers that they offer would not have been eaten by my kids-I tried the hotdog, and I wouldn't eat it either.Rooms were adequate, not luxurious, but very clean with lots of closet space. They have a small refrigerator that doesn't cool very well and 2 small safes, neither of which would lock properly. Negatives: If you don't speak french, don't expect to make a lot of new friends, don't expect to be seated with english speaking guests at dinner. My guess is that 90% of guests were french. With this comes topless sunbathing  thong bikinis; If this bothers you, you might consider another resort. Kids: Looks like a great kids club for those parents that wanted to spend the $ to enroll their children. Most children were in the infant to 6yr age group. That means at every meal there were screaming children, crying babies, and parents who have never heard of disciplining their children. While at the pool, there were a number of toddlers around the deep end of the pool with no adult close by. At the beach, there were unsupervised children galore, and I wonder why children don't end up getting hurt, since their parents don't seem to watch them very well. Dress ran the gamut from semi formal to ultra casual at all meals, but casual was the norm.Hints: If you want to spend time in the sun, wear your swimsuit to breakfast with a cover-up, and on your way to the restaurant, deposit your sunglasses, towels, books etc in a lounge chair. If you eat first, then go back to your room to change, there will not be any chairs left. On the beach, avoid the white plastic chairs, they are not as comfortable as the blue.You are expected to check out by 11, but club med provides wonderful changing rooms with lockers, showers, towels etc., so you can check out, put your carryon in the locker  then go to the beach until your afternoon departure. Don't depend on the airport transfers being included, even though it says so in your papers from your travel agent. We waited an hour at the airport trying to get transportation to the resort, and on the way home, had to pay for a taxi, since suddenly, there were no english speaking GO's around. Taxi is $10 each way to the airport, so plan ahead! It was an enjoyable getaway, but I would have to say that I would certainly book a 7 day carribean cruise before I would spend a week at this resort.",

        "content": "I tussled between average and very good for my overall rating because there was nothing that wowed me about my stay at the San Juan Marriott Resort - in fact there were more things that pushed my stay toward average than very good. Let me explain... CHECK-IN: We arrived early (well before 4:00 PM check-in) on Monday, April 2nd. I was very happy the front desk was able to accomodate us early but not so happy that the front desk clerk seemed a little robotic and a tad bit unfriendly. I'm never expecting cartwheels but actually looking up at me as you're speaking to me and a smile would be nice. ROOM: We get to our room and it's typical full-service Marriott - comfy bed, too soft pillows, typical amenities, the usual. On the upside, the room was airy and clean (except for the hair left behind on the bathroom floor), there was a fridge and the partial ocean view from our \"city view\" room was a definite plus! HOTEL AREA: If you're visiting Puerto Rico looking for a rich, historical and cultural experience be sure to rent a car and venture far from the Condado area and this San Juan Marriott. This area of San Juan felt more like South Beach Miami to me. It wasn't until I ventured out of the area that I felt like was in Puerto Rico. High-rise condominiums, Starbucks, Walgreens, Fuddruckers, Pizzeria Uno's, Wendy's, Chili's are all within walking distance from the hotel (all of which I can get at home) -which brings me to my review... FOOD: We ate breakfast at La Vista in the hotel and honestly, the best thing about this restaurant was our server Senora Clarimar and perhaps the view (running a distant second). Clarimar was genuinely friendly, she was sweet and extremely helpful with guiding us on what to see in Old San Juan and other parts of Puerto Rico. The ONLY reason we chose to eat there a second time was because of her and the wonderful service she provided. Otherwise, skip it!!! La Vista is drastically overpriced (buffet 24.95 pp) and the food was edible but not great. As we took an early morning walk around the neighborhood one day, we noticed a few local spots serving breakfast for much less. Take the walk and save a bunch! GETTING AROUND: We rented a car which I definitely suggest. I bought my GPS along which I HIGHLY recommend. GPS may not be as reliable in PR since road changes accur so often but it's good to have and a general guide. One morning before heading off to the rainforest (which I'll review seperately) we stopped to ask the concierge for directions. Without looking up, she handed me a pre-printed direction card and sent me on my way. ***SIGH*** HOTEL ACTIVITIES: We didn't spend a great deal of time at the pool so a review wouldn't be fair. I can say that there's an activity board posted daily so check that for what's happening around the pool. Included as \"justification\" for your hefty 16% resort fee is a one hour two bike rental. Use it! The pre-printed resort fee \"justification\" card says one bike, two hours but Senora Rita at the activities desk quickly made the correction for us. One note of caution, when biking on the streets in the area BE CAREFUL - drivers in PR are unforgiving! CHECK-OUT: I didn't wait long to check out and was disappointed I had to wait at all. The in-room express check-out wasn't working. I stay at Marriott properties because, for the most part, I know what to expect. Some stays I am wowed and that's because of the people and service. This Marriott did not WOW me and I'm not sure I'd stay here again.",

When my girlfriend and I arrived Tuesday night at 7pm our room wasn't ready, so in response they offered us \"free drinks at the bar while we wait\", so we thought that was appropriate given check-in is 4pm. Finally at 8:30pm, our room was ready. Our room had a partial Ocean view, facing east 15th floor. The balcony view was great but the problem was that the bathroom was sooo small! I mean I have stayed at hotels with closets bigger than that! We learned to live with it though. The room itself was small too - I have stayed at hotels with bathrooms larger than that room, lol. We booked a deal for $150/night while the published rate was $300/night. I'd be pretty pissed if I'd have paid that for the room that we had. The other problem was with housekeeping. We stayed 9 nights, and they didn't change our sheets the entire time! I knew this because the first night my girlfriend's makeup smudged on the sheets and it was still there when we checked out. We only ate at the beach bar and the food was pretty good, maybe a little overpriced, but not by much. In the end, we found that it was actually a great hotel for just relaxing by the beach all day, which caused us to simply forgive the hotel for its obvious issues.",

Catie Copley, the Canine Ambassador, is a warm, welcoming face after a hard day of site seeing. The rooms are clean and fairly spacious with comfortable, well-appointed beds. The bathroom was way too small to maneuver about comfortably. However, it's a lovely hotel, right in the heart of the action. Would I return? In a heart beat!",

This hotel is ideal for this as the parade comes around Copley plaza where the hotel is situated. The rooms were very well equipped and we were given a free upgrade which gave us a separate lounge area. We didn't eat in the Hotel so can't comment on the food but we did go in the Oak room for cocktails and drinks. This is a very cosy place to sit and enjoy a drink or two. Would recommend this hotel to anybody",

        "content": "Have stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza before so I knew the hotel would meet all my expectations. Spent the 4th of July night there and was checked in promptly with no issues. One negative (though minor but still rare for a top notch hotel like the Copley Plaza) was that the staff was not attentive when we walked in with bags. No attempt to help us and even after checking in ... no attempt to bring our bags up to our room (the front desk didn't even ask if we had bags and if we needed help). It's an oversight worth noting (even though I am very capable of handling my own bag) because you would not expect this and never experienced it prior. The room was laid out perfectly and plenty of space. Another minor thing that completely stood out was the half empty bottle of water just sitting on the table. Big oversight for a first rate hotel (and a bit gross since it leads you to question how thorough they clean). The room did appear clean though and the bed was comfortable. Ordered room service and it came up promptly and hit the spot. We ordered extra towels and said we would be leaving the room and to leave them on the bed. No one delivered them. We called again and eventually got them upon our return. The small \"misses\" are noted because of the hotel wanting to be a 5 star facility and my prior experience being so positive. Had breakfast the next day in the Oak Room and it was excellent.",

If you are looking for a 'Boston' experience, then you have a great location and very nice hotel. The downside - The hotel is not great for kids or for folks looking for a lot of space. The rooms are beautiful, but small and really ornate. You are across the street from the Westin and can easily enter the entire Copley system (i.e. no need to walk in the snow to reach the mall and other Copley hotels). My kids love Katie (the Copley mascot) and the great people. The gold level is very nice and the gold level concierge, breakfast, and evening cocktails are great. The rooms just feel a bit tired, so I'll probably look for other options (maybe Fairmont Battery Warf, Nine Zero on Beacon Hill, or the Intercontintental on the waterfront)",

        "content": "Culebra is a quiet island, a place to relax, a place to enjoy sunshine, beaches, and snorkeling. We have enjoyed visiting Culebra eight times, staying at Tamarindo Estates the last six times. A special place to which we will surely return. Tamarindo Estates is a modest, well-maintained, gated refuge. The twelve house-keeping units are small but adequate---simple but clean. The kitchens are OK for breakfasts and lunches; we have not tried to cook dinners. The terraces provide spectacular views of sunsets and starry, night-time skies. The management is friendly and responsive to all requests. The Tamarindo Estates private waterfront is broken coral, not sand, and access to the water is difficult (enter at the north end), but once in one finds wonderful snorkeling (turn south, left, along the outer edge of the coral heads). A quarter-mile walk distant is Tamarindo Beach, which provides sand and easy access for less spectacular snorkeling. Difficult to reach Carlos Rosario Beach may offer snorkeling better or equal to that at Tamarindo Estates, but there is no other equal on the island or perhaps elsewhere in the Caribbean. Also on the Tamarindo Estates waterfront is a small, well-maintained, fresh-water swimming pool. A Jeep is essential on Culebra. We have rented from Carlos. Three colmados in town provide adequate grocery selections. Restaurants change from year to year, with Mamacitas, Dinghy Dock, and Barbara Rosaâ€™s perennial and enduring favorites. Flamenco Beach is spectacular. It is crowded on weekends, as is much of the island, which makes one appreciate even more the privacy of Tamarindo Estates. We have stayed on Belize, Bonaire, Saint Vincent, and Puerto Ricoâ€™s big island. Culebra tops all, and Tamarindo Estates is in our opinion the best place to stay on Culebra.",

        "content": "We are from New York and traveled to Puerto Rico for a family reunion and decided to do it at Tamarindo Estates. Each little apartment kitchen had everything we needed from dishwashing soap in the kitchen, pots and pans, paper towels and the bathrooms were clean and wer also equiped with soap, shampoo and conditioner. Each small apartment has a balcony with tables and chairs. There is a shower outside to clean up before going to the apartment. There is a barbecue pit in front of the villas with tables. The place was clean and comfortable. The walk to the beach is a long one but once you get there the view is fabulous. The pool is a good size and the pool house is equipmed with bathrooms and shower. The beach house has tables and you can also barbecue there. The property manager was very helpful and was always there when we needed him. Adults and kids enjoyed the place. The best snorkling in the island is right in front of this property, we found out it is a natural reserve. The only problem we found is that you must bring your food supplies from the main island or be prepared to pay the prices of culebra. They do not have supermarkets but small stores. We found everything we needed but not always in the same place. Make sure that you rent a jeep (we did) or you will not be able to move around at wish. We did find that taxi drivers are easy to find and during off hours if you make previous arrangements they will pick you up and wait for you to take you back to the hotel. There are many restaurants in town. Recommendations: The most beautiful beach is Flamenco beach - a taxi ride away. You can walk it but there are no side walks and you can not always see the cars coming so we decided it was safer to drive there. There you will find kiosks with food and beverages. Make sure you get your ferry tickets early as they sold out fast and be on line at least an hour before if you are traveling with luggage. There is a car transport that works from Monday to Friday, if you want to take your car from the mainland a reservation is needed but it does not work on Saturday and Sundays. All and all we will do it again. If what you are looking is a quiet, peaceful place full of nature. This is it. We are ready to do it again..",

We had reservations at \"A Wind Chimes\" hotel and were told they did not have our reservation but we could stay at their sister hotel, Acacia. We were told at ten o,clock at night to carry our bags down the very dark street to the Acacia. Wait a moment, we were booked at one hotel and switched to another. For two weary travelers it was to much to comprehend and we trudged to the Acacia. Beware upon arrival they slam you with there rules one of which is you can not get your money back if the room does not meet your expectations. I awoke to having a severe allergic reaction which I recognized instantly as being the result of the presence of mold. My husband investigated and found considerable mold in the bathroom and air conditioner. My husband and I agreed that we could not remain at the hotel. We expressed our desire to leave the hotel to the desk clerk who referred the matter to her manager.The manager was a very rude women who in no uncertain terms advised us that we had booked a four night stay and if we desired to leave we would be charged for a three night stay. To our shock, the problems my wife was having with the mold in the room WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED!!! We left the hotel very bitter and completely resentful of the way we were treated. So beware if you should become ill or have an emergency you will be in for the three night stay rule.",

        "content": "We stayed at Acacia for 3 nights for our first trip to Puerto Rico. This place is gorgeous! Spanish architecture with multi-levels and walkways between rooms. The director and all of the other staff were so accommodating. They help with anything you need (cabs, places to go, etc) and are on a first name basis. Our king room was a perfect size with a large tv and private bath (all of them have private bathes) and the bed was comfy with soft, light linens. We read reviews about kings being two twins stuck together, but that was not the case. Our room had a private back balcony, but many of them had front balconies overlooking the HUGE hot tub. The tub is amazing to say the least. It's the largest one in San Juan with jets everywhere and two waterfalls. The view from the pool and most balconies is a partial oceanview. The tall tower The hotel is so close to the beach, which is great for walking back easily. Pamela's on the beach is just east (a 10 minute beach walk) where you can eat in the sand. They have outdoor showers to rinse off, towels and cucumber/fruit water available in the lobby, and on the ground level is this delicious restaurant called Niche ... let's just say the food is unbelievable. Best meal in San Juan. Some tips to note to travelers: this is not a cookie cutter resort with all of the amenities. What you get with this place is a cozy, comfy little getaway. It is on the east end of Condado, so a bit away from the happening bars and restaurants and a bit further from Old San Juan. However, its close enough for long walks or short cab rides and is worth the peacefulness, service, food, and beach location! There is a really cool deli (Kasalta - that President Obama visited) and other restaurants to the east that are easy to walk to from Acacia. We highly recommend this place and expect to stay again in the near future.",

        "content": "You wake up one day and decide to take a trip to Puerto Rico. You surf the internet - you read the reviews - and think \" Well if it is even 75% as good as the reviews, it should be ok\".... Well, I can tell you first hand that the Acacia Seaside Inn is everything I read about and more. The staff - Brenda, Freddy - were so helpful in assisting us with our day trip plans. Brenda's suggestion of a day trip to Vieques to do the Bio-Kayak tour was incredible. She said it was \"the best\" and it was. I fell in love with Vieques Island and the sister property - Inn on the Blue Horizon. Brenda gave us directions for every phase of the trip, from the transportation to the ferry to setting up the Kayak and snorkeling tours for us. Our room on the second level, adjacent to the hot-tub made for some very relaxing evenings after dinner. The Inn is immaculate - from the entry lobby to our room. The hot tub and surrounding area was washed down everyday as well as all tile areas around the Inn. Our room with two double beds was very spacious. Now, let's talk about getting around. The Inn is located in Condado, and we walked almost everywhere. Very safe, as there was always lots of activity and great police presence. When we needed a taxi, the front desk called and it was never more than 4 mintues until the taxi arrived. And of course, the beach is 1/2 block down the street from the Inn and clean and beautiful. We walked down Ashford to shopping, casinos, restaurants and the lovely gem of a spa - Euphoria. If you want the BEST food in San Juan - JUST STAY AT THE ACACIA AND DINE AT - NICHE!!!! We had our breakfast daily of the most lovely fresh fruit and coffee. Dinner - served by the most lovely Donna, was incredible...... Lobster soaked in vanilla and pumpkin risotto.......beef that melts in your mouth.......asparagus/mushroom risotto...... Believe me when I say they are there to take care of you. The wine list was very reasonable and had great selection. And did I mention the LOVELY DONNA????? If you are looking for loud noise, bustling activity, impersonal service, and cookie cutter environment then this is not the place.......BUT should you want to spend your vacation with a wonderful group of people, in a relaxing, clean, well appointed Inn that has access to all the \"night-life\" if you choose, and great hot tub if you don't, then please make a reservation for the Acacia - you will not be sorry. PS: We stayed for 8 nights - so we really got to know the staff and the Inn.....they never changed - from check-in to check-out it was a wonderful choice for my first week long vacation since 2007!",

Chad; parter, concierge and all around hospitality guru, walked us past the most amazing Buda (see pic) and into Niche. We can't say enough about Chef Cristian who effortlessly prepared the biggest, most succulent lobster we've ever tasted. Then, coaxed by the granite, nearly lappool-sized jacuzzi we decided to stay. It's a given that the rooms are more than comfortable. We had the best forced layover we could imagine.",

        "content": "My husband and I are currently vacationing in Puerto Rico. I have a high stress job, and before the summer season gets busy, we thought it would be good to plan a short vacation. We are couple in our 30s from DC, and we love to travel. We take a few trips each year throughout the Caribbean, the U.S. and around the world. Initially, we looked at Acacia because of the amazing reviews, but settled on La Concha Renaissance because of Marriott points and the pools. The Renaissance is nice, but we wish we would have stayed at Acacia. During our trip, we had an opportunity to visit Acacia's restaurant, Niche, for dinner. I've eaten at many upscale restaurants in my time, but this is in my top 20 of dinners. The food was creative and amazing, plus the chef came out to greet us - very nice guy. Chad Siegel - I can't say enough. Chad manages the hotel, and is extremely knowledgeable, nice, and understands the importance of customer service. I work in PR, a very customer-service based business and I don't understand how people don't get it. Although we stayed at the Renaissance, Chad was our concierage. He was extremely patient with us, and took time to answer our questions and provide entertainment and restaurant recommendations, and we were not even staying at the Acacia. Honestly, the concierage at the Renaissance was not as helpful or knowledgeable. Our experience in Puerto Rico would have been miserable if we didn't stop by Niche and talk with Chad. He also took the time to give us a tour of the hotel - absolutely romantic and beautiful. We were bummed because we saw what we were missing. The next time I visit Puerto Rico, I'm staying at Acacia and booking room #307. Acacia - Mike and Catrell thank you for taking such good care of us.",

        "content": "I did a fair amount of research to find a smaller high-end hotel near the ocean (a block) and central enough to enjoy the restaurants and the general culture. I am happy to report I got both. The front of the house staff Claudio and Palmerra were excellent. Both very professional, genuine and very nice people. The hearts of the people of San Juan are large and that is what makes it such a great place to visit. I like smaller intimate places because you actually get to know the staff first hand and the owner is a lucky man to have these two steering his ship. But wait there's more...the food is fabulous... however you need to cut through the hype and get to the real wonderful Puerto Rican and Caribbean cuisine..it's a family oriented culture and food matters. I am very judgmental when it comes to my food...I want the place clean, I want good service, I want to feel the owner gets what he is doing and wants to deliver consistently. My three hands down favorites were Kasalta's for breakfast every morning one of the local hangouts (they have lunch, dinner and take out as well)...Kasalta's is a gem. Picayo at the art museum is on the fine dining side and is also fabulous...the front of the house Maitre D', Martin is a gifted man when it comes to hospitality and on my second visit Martin introduced us to Chef Wilo Benet who is a force in the cuisine of his country. An engaging chef who cares about delivering fine high end food. Metropol another local down home Puerto Rican eatery was another treasure. The waiter Raffie took a one look at me and told me I had to try the roast pork (I guess he knows his Boston Irish tourist palettes), the engaging staff immediately served up some amazing bread, and Raffi kept the house wine from Spain coming...Raffi brought out a bowl of chopped garlic marinated in olive oil as a sauce for the pig and I was in heaven! A few other mentionable's were Miro, Bebo and the Tapas bar (forget the name) next to Dragon Flies in old San Juan...on the down side Pasteria near the hotel was a bust lots of staff but no service, no one cleaning the tables or cleaning the place...so the floor was strewn with napkins and food. No excuse for that in my opinion... it starts at the top and the owner doesn't get the food service business. I was also disappointed in BuddaThai. El San Juan on Friday and Saturday nites is fun. I also suggest getting up early one morning grabbing a few bottles of water and walking to Old San Juan..its a good hike (5 or so miles)...but will give you a great idea of the area and what is all about. There is a great lagoon right before the bridge. All and all Acacia was exactly what I needed. We both work long hours and I travel a lot so we just wanted to chill and pretty much do nothing except hit the beach, take a bunch of hikes, and check out the local cuisine.",

Room took well over an hour to cool off because even once AC came on fan would only run on low. All this on top of hotel under construction and staff very pokey. Would never return period.",

Not much atmosphere when we were there; one large group by itself and 2 solo drinkers. Rooms were very nice; bed very comfortable. No noise from adjacent room or hallways. Based on past reviews I had asked to be away from the center atrium. Definitely away from things; you have to travel about 20 minutes to get anyswhere. Hard to reach, even with Mapquest but worth the trip.",

The hotel staff is pretty friendly and their shuttle service will take you to the airport and the nearby train stop, which we utilized many times. There is nothing exciting in walking distance, but the train will take you downtown in about 15 minutes and costs a few dollars each way. We went downtown every day to shop and eat at fabulous restaurants. If you are looking for a comfortable hotel located away from the downtown life, this is a good choice.",

The location is only two blocks from Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Highlands (which had great restaurants and shopping). Valet parking was $20 per day and well worth it. We did not use our car and walked everywhere. Free breakfast was included which was on the fourth floor which was where our room was. The desk clerks were extremely nice and helpful. They recommended places to eat and answered all our questions. Internet service worked perfectly plus we noticed a computer open to the public on our floor. Only one slight problem - the tv remote would not work - but someone was sent up and he promptly fixed it. Despite being in the hubble of downtown Hollywood, the room was very quiet.",

Small store in lobby sells drinks and microwavable items. Valet parking required during the summer. $20.00 daily parking fee added to checkout bill. Would recommend but wish it were cheaper.

        "content": "Good points: Very clean, nice decor, nice complimentary breakfast, nice pool, free computer use, good value, very central in LA for public transport (metro bus & trains 5 minutes walk away) if do not have a car, very handy to Hollywood Walk of fame, Madame Tausands Wax museum, Ripleys Believe it or not, theatres etc (5 minutes walk) & Universal studios (10 minutes by local bus @ $1.50 ea way). Will look after bags if check out early & pick up later. Seemed to have a nice clientele - lots of friendly people from Europe, Canada and Australia staying there, many families. Negative points: Room was very stuffy because windows do not open much. Many rooms only look into a wall (not good if claustraphobic!) Busy street - traffic very noisy - we had to turn on the air conditioner all night so it would drown out the road noise. Police sirens, helicopters & fire engines much of the night. Hollywood is generally quite a seedy area - lots of homeless people, beggars & weirdos wandering about, but most of LA seems to be like that these days! I noticed that the Magic Castle Hotel, very nearby, is on a quieter street and gets very good reviews, but it charges a lot more. Recommend eating at The California Pizza restaurant, upstairs on the corner of Hollywood & Highland. Greek Pizza scrumptious. Recommend not booking any LA tours until you arrive as they offer lots of discount vouchers in the main street, as well as deals for seeing multiple attractions, such as a tour plus wax museum. This hotel was also selling two day passes to Universal studios for the price of 1 day (but note that it is much cheaper to take local bus than to buy a pass that includes transport). We did La City Tour A1 - Venice Beach (very, very seedy & dangerous at night), Santa Monica Beach, Dowtown including oldest house in LA, Hollywood, then Movie Stars houses in Beverly Hills etc. A good way to see a great deal of LA in one day. But be aware that if you initially get a crappy seat on their mini bus they make you stay in the same one all day even though you paid as much as the people in the front row (good reason not to give a tip to tour guide who insists on noboby moving seats!) We also took the local bus (Dash Hollywood @ 25cents each) to the Beverly Centre shopping mall - there are also Outlet stores across the road at \"The Beverly Connection\" - designer shoes, handbags, clothes at greatly reduced prices.",

Reasonable parking on site and if eating out gets too much then there is a good store/Subway etc just across the road. Breakfast for a hotel of this class was really great and the lady running the breakfast room was lovely. Only issue we had was a bit of noise. Our room looked out over a next door hotel's parking lot and they had no qualms about firing up their noisy bus, right outside our room at 6am and letting it run for half an hour. Also our room was opposite the laundry and so 'thanks' go out to those girls who congregated there and chatted away at full volume whilst we tried to sleep and who also ignored our requests (twice) to please take their conversation elsewhere (perhaps their own room??). Don't these people realise that all those doors in the corridors are bedrooms at the end of the day? Of course being so close to the 'action' our saturday night was punctuated by significant noise from late night revellers (drunks) coming home at all hours. OK so these might not be directly the hotel's fault -there is no accounting for people, but maybe hotels should try and take some responsibilty - heck why not even put up a sign saying no noise after 10pm or something - it might be a start!",

Our room was a great size, had two double/queen beds, a sofa bed, small table and chairs. Also a small kitchen area with a microwave, small fridge. I thought the room would be noisy as it overlooked busy road, it turned out to be a very quiet room. Breakfast was great, it is a continental breakfast, but is more than adequate to get you through the morning. It consisted of cereal, toast, bagels, boiled eggs, juices, yoghurt, coffee, tea and hot chocolate ( I seem to recall scrambled eggs and bacon too, but am not 100% sure). Had pizza and salad from across the road, which was great. There is also a Subway sandwich shop and a small general store. The proximity of this hotel to the walk of fame, train etc was fantastic. It was an easy five minute walk from the hotel to this hub. Many restuarants in the large shopping centre, plus lots of shopping around. We took a bus from this area to venice beach (well two buses), it took close to an hour to get there. Staff were great and helped book a car for our return to the airport, and printed our boarding passes. Would absolutely stay here again.",

        "content": "We stayed in Hollywood for the last phase of our American honeymoon and had a pretty good time. Hollywood itself seems to be quite overrated but the hotel was a great place to call home for six days. Check-in was easy and all of the front desk staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant. Had a nice chat with the girls while they were watching the Super Bowl during the quieter moments of the day. They even helped us plan our trip to the San Diego Zoo (and remembered us well enough to ask how it was when we returned). The room was quite spacious though perhaps a little dark with no proper lights, only floor and table lamps. Bathroom was nice and the bed super comfy...not much street noise either and you'd never know that busy Hollywood Blvd was close by. Free buffet breakfast every morning was a Godsend - nice supply of toast, bagels, cinnamon rolls, various cereals, milk, yoghurt, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, coffee, fruit, and more...fabulous! As a tip, it's probably a good idea to swipe a couple of paper plates, bowls and some cutlery from the breakfast room in the morning as although there is a kitchenette in the room, there is nothing to eat your food on or with. Only had two problems during our stay, both of which were handled by staff very, very quickly. Once our room key stopped working and it was immediately replaced by the girls on the desk, and towards the end of the trip our toilet backed up but the maintenance man was quick to fix that also. The free Wi-Fi was horribly slow at times in our 4th floor room...that's probably the only real complaint I would have. The small business centre was more than adequate for those times where we had to email home. We didn't have a car for the whole duration of our holiday but as tourists we made good use of the hop-on hop-off buses that most major touristy cities have. The company we used in Hollywood started from outside the Chinese Theatre so that was very convenient and the information they provided, as well as the variety of loops to take you to Downtown LA, Santa Monica, the hills, etc were great. Ordered in a couple of nights from some of the restaurants listed in the hotel's booklet...good experiences all round. There's a convenience store and Subway across the road (if you can ignore all of the scary people hanging around at night), and the sushi restaurant, Shinto is to die for! Best sushi, and affordable, that I have ever had! Overall we had a great stay at Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Hollywood Walk of Fame.",

The hotel was located near a few popular museums and within walking distance to a few restaurants...but the price and overall hotel experience is not worth this location. Amsterdam is a small city and you can walk to everything easily (or take public transportation). The hotel is not very sound proof - I could hear trams running, cars driving on the street, and people talking on the street all night long. I could also hear other people in other hotel rooms talking and walking around their room. On my first day at the hotel, I was waiting to talk with the receptionist while he was helping another person. Thee receptionist created a hotel card key for my room for this person. I only caught this because I was standing at the reception desk and the receptionist said here is a key for room 312 as the people were walking, I pointed out to the receptionist that room 312 was my room...the receptionist called back the people and made them a different key. Not sure what would have happened if I would not have been standing at the reception desk. I would not stay in the hotel again.",

Come to think of it, best way to describe a single room is sleeping in hot engine room to an old steam ship in a storm. wifi works if wind in the correct direction for periods of 5 seconds in every hour. sorry almost forgot about breakfast, you need to go down the steepest stairs (like a ladder) to the basement where you will wished you had not.",

Breaksfast included meats, cheeses, coffee, tea, cold cereal, hardboiled eggs, juice and baguettes -- it filled us up for most of the day! The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and even though we were in a smoking room you never would have noticed -- absolutely no smoke stench. The hotel is located within walking distance of most of the Amsterdam museums and the street were is located is home to some pretty shwanky shopping (Cartier, Hugo Boss, Gucci etc...) but the price of the hotel would never lead you to believe this! We plan to return to Amsterdam and will definitely make our reservation at Hotel Smit again.",

The pool area was fabulous but no jaccuzzi. The non alcohol drinks they offered in the lounge were new and amazing. Freash squeezed blue-berry juice, soda and lavender. You died and went to heaven and God gave you a welcome drink! The menu for food and drinks at this hotel are more advanced and futuristic than anything I have experienced in LA 5 star hotels. The Bentley driver Jim was my fav as he drove us to dinner and other places. Nice touch with the hotel car. But then again it is supposed to be a 5 star. It is worth a stay and the staff were wonderful. Very friendly as apposed to the stuck up ( God only knows why) Canadians that were at the hotel, all New Yorking on everyone, with their noses in the air. Mostly women. Maybe they were uptight because there are never any good looking men in Vancouver. I was born and raised in vancouver so I know of what I speak. Any hoo, go and stay there if you get the chance, it's worth the experience, and if you are a nice looking gentleman you can probably have your pick of the beautiful stuck up Canadian women. Me included!",

Attention to detail and decorating excellence like the Peninsula in Beverly Hills back when it was brand new. This is the new benchmark.. Toss the Fairmont Pac Rim (I've stayed in the Pacific Rim's Chaiman's suite for a week and liked this place head and shoulders better). Unfortunately the Loden and Opus are out - Poor Locations. Toss the Sutton.. (wayy in need of updates) Toss the Bayshore.. old and routine with just a few great rooms.. Toss the Four Seasons.. It's right across the street and this place pput's it to jawdropping shame. There is not another hotel in the city of Vancouver, not one that you want to hang your hat at after you've stayed here. I would come back to Vancouver JUST for this hotel. THAT's how you know when you've found the best - It just completely and unequivocally blows your hair back. I've stayed in more hotels in my life than I care to remember and I predict that this place will have waiting lists within a year. Note to management: Take the yoga room that nobody is using and put some freeweights and a bench in there.. The gym had no free weights.. That's the only fault.",

The Rosewood group completed a four year construction project in July, 2011. It is a great hotel with quality staff from check-in, concierge, bell captain, valet parking and a Bentley car, with driver, for less than 5 Kms from hotel. Our room was good sized with a sitting area, large flat screen TV, ample closet space with a great bathroom with two sinks, great overhead shower as well as a bath tub. The electrical lighting system was great throughout the hotel room. The Hotel has a great restaurant called the Hawksworth, on site as well as two bars/cocktail areas in the hotel. We would without doubt stay at the Rosewood on our next trip to Vancouver.",

        "content": "Having stayed at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia 2.5 weeks after a grand opening from a massive gutting and renovation of this landmark Vancouver property, and a rebranding to the Rosewood name, I found this property to be pure classic luxury with the highest standards to offer their guests. The entire staff are outstanding, most welcoming, hospitable, and takes great interest in your stay at their property. The entire staff are very proud to be at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia and their enthusiasm definitely shines through. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful while very relaxing. I did not get that stuffy feeling you can get staying at a top luxury hotel. The hotel exudes a welcoming, sit down and relax feeling. The furnishings in the lobby are gorgeous and fits the decor perfectly. The room I had was on the 6th floor overlooking Howe Street. The room windows do open wide - how refreshing it was to find this. I could hear no noise at all, street level or outside the room. The room itself is luxury. The furnishings, color coordination, bed and bedding (the best ever) (sorry Frette) and lighting are perfection. I might also add very, very, comfortable, beautiful, and of the best craftsmanship. Touch lighting is utilized throughout the room. A computer keyboard in the desk drawer is available for use anytime and set up through the television system - and free of charge. A very nice touch and was used. I also liked the Seiko alarm clock that was stylish yet very simple to set an alarm. We know how hotels have gotten with trying to set an alarm on a clock. The bathroom - possibly the best I have encountered, Huge is not the word. You could live in the bathroom it is so big and beautiful. Everything is well thought out even down to the heated floor. You could have a party in the rainforest shower it is that big or possibly a smaller gathering in the soaking tub. All the amenities are there that one would expect at a luxury hotel and of the very highest quality. The fitness center/spa/pool are amazing. The fitness center has all the newest and latest equipment available in a wonderful and airy room to work out in. Again, all the nice touches one would look for at a hotel of the caliber are available. The pool area in my opinion is the second best feature of this hotel. Stunning, breathtaking, unbelievable are just a few words to describe this indoor pool area. Chairs, chaise lounges, couches, towels - again no expense spared in having the absolute best for this hotel. I actually felt like I was in some kind of Roman bath. You must stay if for anything the pool area. I did have breakfast at Hawksworth Restaurant. Decor, service, and food were excellent and price point was what is expected of a dining establishment of this high caliber. Absolutely no complaints for breakfast at Hawksworth. I utilized the business center and was very surprised to see two brand new Mac computers, the top of the line Mac computers for complimentary use. Being Mac illiterate, the hotel staff was most helpful in getting me started. The 1927 lobby bar was very nice, the drink was excellent, service outstanding, and pleasant, and overall a very relaxing time spent. Definitely have a drink or two there. The staff of the Rosewood Hotel Georgia is the #1 best feature of this property. Of the staff, the concierge staff I had multiple dealings with, Heather and Rob are the shining stars of the Hotel Georgia. Both are Members, Les Clefs d'Or Canada as well as the other team member of the concierge staff and one will be attaining membership into this prestigious organization in November, making the Rosewood Hotel Georgia the only hotel in Canada to have four Members Les Clefs d'Or Canada. This staff, again, particularly Heather and Rob know the city of Vancouver nside and out, all recommendations were right on, and some unusual requests were handled professionally, timely, and always with the result I the guest was looking for. My many interactions with this team certainly made me feel like I was their only guest. Heather and Rob are very special people and take pride in their work and pride in their hotel. I cannot highly recommend enough using their knowledge and services offered. As I said at the beginning of this review, all staff members are enthusiastic, proud of their job, and proud to be of any service to their guests to make the stay a very memorable on. I was fortunate to be able to utilize the Bentley car and driver, Jim, to the Pacific Central Station. What can I say, I will never forget the ride, the car, nor Jim. Jim is a pleasure to talk to, always smiling, cheerful, and cares so much about the guest. He is such an asset to this organization and someone I shall not forget. Professional and caring at all times -- what more can you ask for in an employee or a person. I actually had wished he could have hopped on the train with me so we could continue our discussions on various topics. I apologize for this lengthy report, however, I really wanted to give future guests a clear picture of this property. Remember please, the Rosewood Hotel Georgia had only been open 2.5 weeks, so there were some issues and definite oversights I saw during my stay. I will say every staff member took their time to listen to my suggestions, ideas, and thoughts and I believe took them to heart. I did not hesitate to let them know too, in a nice way. To give you a good idea, the following was what I found. I was skipped one night for turn-down service. Was offered a very sincere apology from the Front Desk Manager regarding this oversight that should have never happened. My room was rather small. Not the huge rooms I have encountered at other luxury hotels. Very little space for clothing. This in my opinion was the weakest and most disappointing part of the hotel. Actually had to have housekeeping come and get the extra pillows and blanket just to give myself more space in the closet. The business center with its new computers,etc., had absolutely no supplies to utilize that is readily available unless it was all hiding. The spa/fitness center/pool area - as absolutely beautiful as it is, offered none of the touches you will find at a luxury property's spa/fitness center/pool, i.e., lockers, (there were only 2), places to sit and change, and all the toiletries that are offered that take it a step higher. No footwear to use while in this area nor were there robes to put on. Also, there was no place to put the wet swimsuit but this issue has been addressed and there will be a suit dryer installed as soon as the equipment gets in. I was very disappointed and surprised to see how lacking this area was in comparison to a Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Shangri-La, Pan-Pacific, and Fairmont properties fitness center/pool area. However, Lenny, Spa Receptionist was outstanding, proactive in tackling my dilemma, and solved my problem. She is definitely the kind of member you want on your team to take you to the top. Again, this was an outstanding stay, all the comforts one could want or ask for. The staff unsurpassed on their duties. The strongest asset of this hotel. However. to reach that pinnacle of being \"the best Vancouver hotel\" it is the small attention to details that separate properties as they are all in the general price range. This is where the Rosewood Hotel Georgia still needs improvement. It will be the little things that take it to the top and a 5-star rating. I will be back and cannot wait to see and notice the changes and the evolving nuances that take place to achieve this hospitality ranking as #1 place to stay in Vancouver. It can happen.",

The  staff are super friendly, the décor is garage sale chic, and there's a lovely courtyard that fills with neighbourhood hipsters on warm evenings. It also has a very good location and you can easily avoid the noise of Pigalle or Montmartre's high prices, but they're within stumble distance if you decide to explore. For early risers breakfast (€5, until 10:00) is served in the attached restaurant/bar. Some English spoken, especially for those who pet the cat sprawled across the reception desk.",

Request a corner room, you get three walls of windows looking over downtown! There are a couple drawbacks to the hotel: the carpet needs to be replaced, the elevators are very slow. But the ambiance makes up for it. The staff are generally realy nice and helpful. I went down to the bar area to buy some OJ after breakfast had ended, and Jesus went to the kitchen and brought me two glasses of fresh squeezed for free! The shuttle is also great, they took us outside of the stated 5 mile radius. It was so convenient when we went out to dinner not to have to drive! There's also celebrities staying there almost constantly. The cast of Prison Break was staying there while we were there, as were the Black Crowes. You definitely can't beat the price for such a fantastic hotel!",

Hotel in a good position, you could walk to JFK sites, Reunion Tower and West End etc. easily. DART public transport was a joy - clean, efficient and very inexpensive (by UK standards).

We asked for a room w/a view & were placed in a corner room on the 24th floor, from which we could see Neiman Marcus below, the Cotton Bowl & the State Fairgrounds in the distance, and everything in between. Although not all standard rooms are decorated this way, our room had oak paneled walls, hardwood floors, & five windows w/ sills deep enough to curl up in. The public areas were amazing. The 2nd floor is dedicated to numerous small intimate seating areas for guests to sit & talk, read a book in front of the fireplace, have a drink w/friends, watch a ballgame, or even play billiards. No matter how many people were there, we always felt we had a \"private\" spot. The evening reception has \"standard fare,\" - true -- but the cheese, veggies, crackers, chips, & salsa, along w/the free drinks -- were served w/a smile, and there was always someone quietly cleaning up any mess from the people before you. We were walking distance to the Convention Center, the West End, and the Kennedy Memorial. The public library is just a couple of blocks, & the newly opened & fantastic \"Iron Cactus\" is LITERALLY out the back door. We thoroughly enjoyed the hot tub on the 3rd floor. It is in a corner room off the gym w/ barred but open (meaning no glass) windows, so the crisp outside air is a factor, but... the tub was warm so the January chill air felt nice. It was a unique experience. We didn't get to use the fitness room, but were impressed w/its equipment & size (how many hotel gyms actually have racks of dumbbells?). There is almost nothing negative I can say about The Magnolia. We will definitely return.",

The room itself was small, and reminded me of a New York City room. The noise from the traffic below could be heard at all hours. That being said, the breakfast was very well done, and the food was replaced quickly when empty. The lobby was presented nicely, although there could have been more staff on hand when I checked in. There were several people in line, and only 1 staff person doing teh work. The area was safe and in walking distance of many resturants.",

I want you to know what i terrible mistake i made by chosing this hotel. As soon as i got there they could not find my reservation in the system and made me buy a bigger more expensive room. This girl i dont wanna mention her name (the only at the hotel on that sunday night) had a very bad atitude. The hotel was empty so i parked my car outside at the door. It wasnt valet, they kept the key and still charged me an extra 25 for that. I arrived around 11 at night and left at 6 next morning, so my car was exactly where i left it. The room costed me around 220 plus taxes and valet costed me around almost $300. The room was very old. The air conditioning/heater had to be turned off cuz of the loud noise it made I couldnt sleep. Everything and all the equipments are very old. The location is very unaccessible and horrible. Im not very familiar with Dallas but that location seemed dangerous to me. the breakfast is very deceiving also. PLEASE DONT GO THERE! The price is really not worth it. they are absolutely insane to have prices like that for such a low quality and bad services. Honestly if you stay at Motel 6 it will feel more luxurious than that! I have originally chosen to stay there cuz of the price, i thought it should be good for that price! I was very wrong! I went next night to the Crowne Plaza and had a blast! I was very amazed with the friendly stuff, great food, great location and FREE accessible parking right in front of the elevators! All of that for half of the price! New comfortable rooms i felt in heaven after the horrible time i had at the Springhill Suites. I have to go back to Dallas several more times and will never ever go back to the Springhill Suites.",

        "content": "We had a reservation for 2 rooms beginning December 31 for 3 nights that we made six or seven weeks in advance. We were in town for a football game and were excited because we were going to take advantage of many of the Downtown activities for New Years Eve. When we arrived at the hotel at 7:30pm, they didn't have our rooms and walked us to a Springhill Suites 6-7 miles away on Loop 12. While they paid for our rooms that night, we didn't get to attend any of the NYE activities because we didn't want to fight the traffic or deal with parking and the NYE drunks. We checked into the hotel again the next morning and our rooms weren't ready. We went out and about and by the time we checked in, there wasn't a king bed room available as we had requested. We also didn't realize till check out, but when they had re-instated our rooms, they put the rate in wrong. The location of the hotel is GREAT as are most of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. They recommeded several places to go that turned out to be excelled. We used valet during our stay and it seemed to be constantly backed up. When we returned to the hotel the last night there after our football game, we left a leather coat and hat in the car. When we returned home, we realized we didn't have either one. From both our memories and our pictures, the only time it could have been taken was from the car that night. I called the hotel a couple of times and left messages for Lost and Found but never recieved a call back. We suspect the valet didn't lock the door and somebody wandered through the parking lot checking for unlocked cars. We realize we shouldn't have left anything in the car but locking the car should be a basic requirement for valet.",

        "content": "I was recently in Dallas for a conference with a group which included several college students on a budget. We booked the Springhill Suites for the amenities it offered, such as the complimentary breakfast and free wireless in the rooms. We were very pleased with our stay and the location of the hotel. Our rooms were large with the extra suite area, so we were able to sleep 3 in a room comfortably. The rooms were clean and the beds quite comfortable (although I can't vouch for the sofa bed, since I didn't sleep on it). The hot breakfast was pretty standard, but a definite plus for the group in trying to save a few pennies. We liked the Texas shaped waffles! The hotel had karaoke the night we arrived, and it seemed like everyone was having fun, but it ended before we could get downstairs to it. The hotel lobby is quite small, but adequate, and the hotel staff were helpful for the most part. I did have problems after I returned home with a hotel clerk in trying to get a copy of my receipt showing my paid bill, but she eventually helped me. We relied upon the conference shuttle and the DART station nearby for transportation, so it was pretty convenient to get wherever we wanted to go. We also liked being able to walk to all the restaurants in the West End at night. There were many to choose from, and the students thought the location of our hotel was great. The Dallas Aquarium is practically at the back door of the hotel, and the JFK sites are close by, as well as restaurants like the House of Blues and Spaghetti Warehouse. Others at the conference who were staying in the hotels by the interstate were jealous of all the restaurants and attractions that were in walking distance of our hotel! Overall, it was a good experience and a great value for a group.",

Now a very cute ''no'' star hotel, its charm more than makes up for what it lacks in amenities (who needs a TV in Paris anyway?). The  staff are super friendly, the décor is garage sale chic, and there's a lovely courtyard that fills with neighbourhood hipsters on warm evenings. It also has a very good location and you can easily avoid the noise of Pigalle or Montmartre's high prices, but they're within stumble distance if you decide to explore. For early risers breakfast (€5, until 10:00) is served in the attached restaurant/bar. Some English spoken, especially for those who pet the cat sprawled across the reception desk.",

Upon returning home I noticed that he charged my card for an additional day even though I hadn't stayed so now as we speak Im disputing this with my bank, and I called Ramada's customer service to let them know and within 30 mins later I get a call from the manager person who basically calls me a liar and tells me I can drive down there anytime to review the video for whatever reason, anyways, avoid at all costs unless you like getting screwed over.",

        "content": "New York City: Comfort Inn Midtown Date: Sept. 26 - 30, 2006 Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member, Burlington,Canada This hotel provides very good value for the money. The room was $162 per night. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was plenty large enough for 2 people. We did not spend a lot of time in the room. Most of our waking hours were spent sight seeing. The room was very clean. The only drawback was that the room faced 46th street and thus was quite noisey. My wife and I are fairly sound sleepers so this did not really bother us that much. Other rooms may be much quieter. The breakfast provided was typical of many hotels. We ate shotly after the breakfast room opened (7:00 am) and found everything satisfactory. The breakfast was as advertised. There was only on small elevator. We did not experience any long waits. We were on the 3rd floor and often walked down the stairs. The location is great. There are many restaurants nearby. Times Square is less than a block away. You can walk to many attractions such as Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, many theaters, Times Square and the bus tours (hop on/ hop off). This is a great place to stay. We would stay here again.",

        "content": "Just came back from a long week-end in NYC. I agree with everybody. Almost everything was perfect about this hotel (location, cleanliness, friendly staff, small but workable room, decent breakfast, storage room). We got there at lunch time and our room was ready. Perfect! The only, but very important, problem is that I could hardly sleep in our room. The cause: the rooms are not soundproofed at all. We could hear the TV and the children speak in the room next to ours and everything that was going on in the hallway (a family was sharing multiple rooms and was constantly going from one room to the others, screaming, laughing and slamming doors; it was awfulâ€¦). In addition, itâ€™s New York City; people were coming in and out at all hours, slamming doors and screaming in the small hallway. I had problems falling asleep because of all the noise and was constantly waken up afterwards. In the middle of the night, after 3 or 4, I was finally able to sleep. If you are like me a light sleeper, you better select another hotel. Since we are more experienced with the subway system now, next time we plan to stay away from Times Square. For about the same price, we will get a much better hotel. We may even be ready to pay a bit more to get a good night sleep.",

If I had known (and if there was vacancies) I would have stayed all week! It was awesome...Nothing like it! I stayed in Cottage D, which was over the water even at low tide. When the tide was up, you could see surfers riding waves right by your room as you sat in the living room. The sound and feel of the waves crashing beneath you are just the coolest most relaxing thing ever. When I do return, I will want that same cottage. A&B are the 2 on the end, but you get more privacy from the public pier on the end. Another great feature is your car is parked right alongside your cottage (easy for loading/unloading!) The staff was amazingly friendly, and has your safety and privacy priority! Thankyou Randy for all your helpful tips on tours, eateries, and directions.

        "content": "I was invited to tag along with some friends that were staying at the Crystal Pier for a few days and I am so glad I did. The location is amazing, the cottages are nicely furnished and the sunsets from the pier are spectacular. A few negatives; we were given cottage 22 which appears to be the â€œruntâ€� of the cottages. It didnâ€™t have a futon as the other cottages have but it did have two twin size roll out beds. We had our own patio but it was so small that it only contained one lounge chair and a small round table with two (not four) patio chairs and no umbrella. The kitchen was so small that we couldnâ€™t reach the microwave unless we moved the dining chairs away from the table. Another issue was that none of the outlets in the kitchen worked except the one the toaster and coffee pot were already plugged into. From what I could see of the other cottages, ours appeared quite a bit smaller. We were disappointed that we didnâ€™t have a French door as the other cottages did and we had to park a good distance from our front door and not in front of the cottage as other guests could. The parking was a nightmare too. You are only allowed one assigned parking spot per cottage and you get locked in by all the other cars lined up bumper to bumper. The front desk clerk was grumpy about us driving through the gate before we got a key but no one was outside to tell us not to. She was less than friendly at check in. Youâ€™d think the front desk staff would be a little nicer and more professional for the amount of money you pay to stay there. The bathroom was fine and the shower had great water pressure. We brought lots of food with us and even made a big dinner one night. The kitchen did have all the basic necessities (pots, pans, dishes & utensils). You can also get a barbeque grill from the front desk (you provide the charcoal). All in all, it was a fabulous stay. I will definitely return but wonâ€™t stay in Cottage 22 again. I donâ€™t think it warrants the same rate as the other larger 1 bedroom units. There are also tons of shops and restaurants very close. I recommend visiting Pangaea for a cool shopping experience but make sure you have enough time to see everything in this large and very diverse store. Also, try Bustamanteâ€™s on Garnet Ave. We had a fantastic breakfast/lunch. Good selection on the menu; Mexican cuisine, plus omelets, pancakes, Belgium waffles, you name it. All very good food made from scratch. Good sized servings and each meal came with a fruit cup to start. Also, Edgar is the best waiter/host you can ask for. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great time and everyone at the table was happy. Be careful not to park on Garnet Street overnight though. I got a $40 ticket for being there between 3am â€“ 6am Tuesday morning when the street sweeper came around.",

While the physical property is interesting, this part of San Diego is a bit dumpy, unless you like homeless people sleeping all around you while you are on vacation at the beach.

It was extraordinary to have every person who I had an encounter with to have such a poor disposition. Beware of this place!",

The only thing I can think of is that these folks are writing poor reviews to \"keep others\" away and have the pier to themselves!

It is situated at the start of the bars, restaurants, and entertainment on gentrified 5th Ave., a stone’s throw from the Westfield Horton Shopping Plaza where tour buses stop. Walking a bit further brings you to the convention center and touristy waterfront. Taxis to must-visit Balboa Park are around $10. We were able to book a very large top floor suite for a weekday rate of less than $200 per night. The small staff who rotate through the front desk were friendly and in our case exceptionally helpful. The hotel’s self-serve breakfast is modest but provided on the roof top (part of which is under cover) where the view more than compensates. We found this historic property to be clean and well maintained… very easy to recommend.",

The dimly lit entrance way, bar and restaurant area set a very relaxed, sexy atmpsphere and perhaps if that vibe was carried up to the actual floors of the hotel then it would work better but after the elevators open to your floor your eyes are surprised to see lilac hallways with white trim (reminded me of a dollhouse)- I never thought I'd be one to care about these things much but it just doesn't go and the color is just ugly. Also, noise travels throught the rooms. My room looked identical to the person before me who posted the pics - small for the price and bed wasn't that comfy. I have to say though, I thought the staff was very nice and overly accomodating. Also in a good area - accessible to everything. I probably won't go back because it is expensive for what it is but would def stop in for a drink at the Redwood Bar - very cool hotel (downstairs that is).",

        "content": "If image is all that matters to you... Your first clue is the lack of signage. The Clift is far too trendy to identify its location by anything so common as a nameplate visible from the street.The valet parking staff is friendly, though, assuming you can find a place for your car on the crowded curb in front of the hotel. Plan on a hefty $40 per night for valet parking.Once inside, the clever theatricality of the lobby, dining room and bar make the efforts to arrive seem worthwhile. Check-in is efficient, if not exactly friendly or welcoming.A warning, though. If you get a room with a pass-through door to the room adjacent, immediately return to the front desk and ask for or pay for a room with solid walls. I did not and my neighbors stayed up all night long playing music and entertaining guests. Despite a call from the manager at 12:30 PM and a call from myself at 3 AM, the noise continued unabated till 4:30 AM, leaving me no recourse but to spend a very early morning in the lobby. Why the lobby? Well, the night staff informed me that while they were sorry, they could not give me another room until the morning manager arrived. Three hours later he did arrive and did give me another room. According to the bell staff, there were ample empty rooms. Apparently due to my group rate, the night staff wasn't authorized to give me another room. In effect, their rules were far more important than my comfort or inconvience. So...no sleep at all at this 4-star hotel the first night.The next night of my four-night stay, a friend and I decided to investigate the bar. The hostess condescended to find us a table and with a great deal of attitude announced that we might have one in a few minutes - depending on how long we were staying!We decided we weren't nearly important enough to enjoy the gloomy darkness and thumpa-wumpa music of the bar at the Clift, so we crossed the street and discovered the delightful Cafe Grand at the equally delightful Hotel Monaco. Evidently Kimpton hotels regard guests as valued friends and Schrager properties - like the ever-so-precious Clift - do not. Unless you share the attitude, of course, and enjoy trading superior glances with the staff.I'll give the Clift ample stars for design and poseur-power. But as a fine hotel...truly, they have a lot to learn about hospitality.",

        "content": "Two words: Bed Bugs My first trip to San Francisco was memorable as a result of staying at the Halcyon. Trying to save on accommodations, this hotel was the least expensive while still being within SF proper. The adage Penny wise, Pound foolish could be the hallmark for this establishment. The room was barely wider than both my arms spread apart. The bed took up almost all floorspace. The bathroom was only slight smaller than the room itself. Fortunately, I didn't unpack my things upon checking in (I left everything in my bag, in the closet). At around 3 in the morning, I felt something against my skin. When I turned on the light, I could see something moving on the sheet. Instinctively I smacked it, and the result was a bright red stain on the sheet. Immediately I threw the covers off, only to find 3 to 4 more of these bugs scampering away. When I called the Manager and showed him the blood stain on my sheet, I asked him did he know that there were BED BUGS in the room?!?!!! His response: we've had them before (WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!!!). After showering and scrubbing off the top layers of my skin, I ended up going to the downtown Marriott. Yes, its cost was 4Xs the price of the Halcyon, but at least the room was clean, spacious, and I didn't have to worry about being bitten in the middle of the night! Believe me, it's worth paying more rather than being infested. If you do decide to stay here, best to keep your clothes packed (and wrapped in plastic) so you don't bring anything back home with you. Like I said before, I was fortunate to have not unpacked. I made sure though that the clothes I was wearing were BOILED before I went to the Marriott.",

I got to know this hotel through the Lonely Planet Guide and booked by e-mail a room in advance for 3 weeks. No problems, booking was confirmed immediately and the room was kept for me on date of arrival. I even received the entrance-code. On the money-aspect, I got a room for only $ 300 a week, less than moderate, given the advice in most travelguides that for less than $ 100 a day almost nothing of any standard is available. But then the place self, on Jonesstreet it is very central located and easy to reach by foot from Marketstreet or Union Square and surroundings, even from Fishermans Wharf with an astounding view of the bay on one of the highest points, especially at night. The room was cosy but comfortable. It had a private bath and toilet, was cleaned up regulary and fresh towels were supplied. On day of arrival there was even neatly placed a tray with shampoo, a sewing kit and wethaircap. Later on a small soapbar was given. Being an European I asked for a electricityplug for switch from Dutch to American use and they immediatily offered to buy one by my self but get a discount from the hotelroomtarif. What a service! In the room were further on a refridgerator, microwave, TV-set, telephone (local calls are free!), alarmclock, even cups and saucers, coffee (!) and sugar, also a coffeemaker, forks and knives. Where do you get this elsewhere for a comparible price? Nowhere I guess. I had the time of my life staying in SF for 3 weeks and at the end of the day returning to a safe and proper place. If I get the opportunity I will repeat my stay in near future, again in the Halcyon Hotel. Thanks Dennis and Mark, helpfull staff members. More questions? You can ask me by e-mail, hanstalsma@zonnet.nl. PS I am just a guest of this hotel, not the owner nor shareholder or whatsoever.",

I got to my room only to find it smelled like smoke and I asked for a non smoking room, when I called down to the lobby the person apologized but did not offer another room. I then had to call back and demand to be moved. The rooms were average size and nice the only problem was the noise from the night club could be heard until 3pm in the morning even though we were on the 53rd floor! The hotel is large and nice but nothing really stood out to me as being special or different or over the top making it unique compared to other hotels in Vegas.

        "content": "So this was my 7th or 8th trip to Vegas and this time I chose Encore as the rate was affordable when booked with flight package. Read a lot of reviews first and club noise and value were the two that concerned me. So first the pros. Steve Wynn has surely built one of the most glamorous hotel resorts anywhere. Just high end luxury abounds around every corner. Like most of the new mega hotel/resorts, this place is a sprawling Utopia with lavish decor, basically a mega mall with hotel, swimming, night clubs, fancy restaurants, and casinos. Encore (and Wynn) is basically a high end very upscale resort fit for the well off One percenters if you will. Its a white collar wonderland but if you happen to be blue collar, you better plan ahead because there are better value options. The staff was absolutely gracious, accomodating. I was concerned about the staff based on other reviews but quite honestly, they could not have been better, however when the safe wouldnt open it took 1 hour for security to help and that is just unacceptable. Upon arrival, I requested a high floor away from the strip as sleep is important to me/us. The request resulted in a $20 per night \"upgrade\" to a 61st floor panoramic view of north and west Vegas which was decent. Unless there is an ocean, the view matters little to me. How long you gonna stand there and look? The rooms are very very nice, huge bathroom. The bed was absolutely without a doubt the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was not sufficiently clean when we went in, as I was looking to substantiate reports of mediocre housekeeping. In particular, they sink counter had splash residue from previous guests that a simple wipe down could have taken care of. Not enough for a complaint to the staff though. The bell boy who brought our bags up took time to explain the technology in the room which was quite helpful and garnered him a worthy tip. Housekeeping the remainder of the trip was timely and there were no issues. DO NOT tough the in room bar or snacks, unless your rich. You can get water and snacks downstairs at the shop by the elevators at still high but more affordable prices. This is NOT a place to take your children, and I would suggest this is an adult resort. So the rooms are nice, the staff was great as expected for a five star. The cons: Value. Be it a bottle of beer, water, coffee, a snack or meal, you are going to pay a premium. For a blue collar guy, this will hurt, but it is common on the strip to pay $7.00 for a bottle of beer. Double that for the clubs you pay to get into. Same for food. Its $50 foir the lunch/breakfast buffets, and over $80 for dinner that is basically that same with slight variation. THere are better values on the strip and the food was medicre for a pricey buffet. The SOciety Restaurant we had breakfast and still pricey for the quality. Service is good, but value no so much. Gaming. I am an avid blackjack player. I did not play one hand at Encore or Wynn and I probably never will. I searched for a mid limit table where dealer stands on soft 17s. Found one at $50 and one at $100. The rest were all dealer hits on soft 17s and that is a big house advantage. So I gambled at more player friendly places. Sad how some expensive Casinos are totally taking advantage of the small bettors. Should be the same for all. So Encore to me is all about the luxury resort itself, something to see, but for value and gaming there are better value options. I will never stay again because I refuse to pay high end prices for mediocre food and I refuse to play a game where house edge is double vs other places. THe one other negative which might be positive for some is location. Its far north end of strip so plan on walking or paying a lot of cab fares to see the rest of the strip. If you are wealthy this place was made for you and thats probably what Mr Wynn intended anyways when he spend 4 billion $ to create it so more power to him and those that can afford it.",

        "content": "This is a beautiful hotel with alot of high end amenities. My husband and I had a 10 night stay in Las Vegas. We stayed in 3 different hotels during our stay. First 2 nights we stayed at the MGM Grand (have stayed here over 5 times). Next 3 nights were at the New York New York Hotel (have stayed here over 5 times). Our last 5 nights were at the Encore (have stayed here 3 times). The encore has far nicer rooms than the MGM and New York New York. The Encore is at the complete opposite end of the strip from the first two hotels. We enjoy changing hotels and getting a different vibe from the different hotels. MGM has fairly large rooms but the views are always terrible. The casino is HUGE. The foodcourt is lively and very busy. There is a nice stroll to shopping facilities as well as many restaurants. When we checked out all we had to do was walk across the bridge to get to New York New York. New York has a younger crowd vibe (we are in our early 50's). The rooms are a little smaller than MGM however compared with other hotels in the U.S.A they would be classified as high end. We have always had good views from our stays at New York. Given a choice I would stay at the New York hotel over the MGM hotel. Casino is smaller and during our Friday Saturday night stay very lively. There is a dual ling piano bar that is very popular and fun. There is also a Irish Pub that is a great place to get a Guinness. Food is reasonably priced at the food court and very good. The deli sandwiches, fish and chips and deserts were particular favorites. We planned our trip that we would not walk any farther than halfway down the strip (we used the Flamingo as our stopping point. When we checked out of New York New York we decided to walk to the Encore (we have made this walk many times on previous holidays so we did know how long it was). Our intention originally was to take a cab but we were energized that day and had no problem pulling our 1 suitcase and carrying our 1 back pack. If you do decide to do this there are many places to stop and sit for a minute if your feet get tired. The vibe at the Encore is immediately so different from the first two hotels. Much more staff attends to you and they really do make checking in and checking out a delight. Much more efficient than the first two hotels. The grandeur of the encore immediately takes you aback. Beautiful, beautiful red decor. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows so views are great. We were on the 28th floor and were offered a upgrade to a higher floor for 20.00 more. We declined the offer and we were very satisfied with the view that came with our room. We ate at the Wynn buffet twice during our stay and upgraded the meal to 10.00 each for all you can drink champagne (there are some other drinks available at that price but we chose the champagne). Someone in another review stated that some of the food was not fresh. I would have to disagree with that statement. Everything was great and all was fresh. We intended to try some of the other restaurants at the Encore but it did not work out for us with the shows we were going to see. In this order my favorites are Encore - Classy New York - Fun MGM - Has everything I would stay at any of these properties again. Have fun in Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!",

        "content": "We've been to Vegas several times and stayed at several places including Belagio. Encore was by far the best so far. The only problem was that the light system would go on everynight at around midnight and wake us up. There was no alarm on or anything and we never figured out why. Other than that, the spa was amazing and had the softest sheets I've ever felt. We had to go purchase them for our home. Also, the smoke smell throughout the casinos is always terrible, but not as bad for some reason at Encore as it was in Belagio or some of the others. We went golfing at the Wynn course and had Ray Romano tee off right before us and David Spade was about an hour behind us. We saw Garth Brooks who put on a great show. We also saw Le Reve by Cirque du soleil which was nice. Overall, best Vegas hotel so far!",

It is decadent from the minute you walk in, highly ornate and spectacular decor throughout the hotel, gaming areas and plush rooms that will make one feel like royalty. The service they provide is to die for, the attention to detail is intricate, and all the restaurants that I tried were spot-on. Encore is bustling with the best night clubs (XS was my favorite!) and high-end shopping. Particularly loved the connectivity to Wynn Hotel which has more gaming,dining and night clubs. The location on the strip is also great, accessible and close to the mall for those who need a break from the casinos. Absolutely loved every minute at the Encore and would hope to be back someday soon!",

Well - we had the room next to us in major partying so I ended up calling the front desk at 4am and they called security to quiten them down. Then the next night we were kept up the entire night with the party going on around the pool – now we were won the 56 th floor so that was loud music! Since staying there I have read a similar review so the hotel are well aware that the party by the pool is very disruptive but still allow it to go on! They sell themselves as a high end sophisticated hotel but there are huge flaws in the Encore experience!",

Loved eating at La Cave and also at Wazuzu. Work out room OK. Spa looked beautiful but we didn't utilize. IF you reserve a car, make sure you find out if it will be at Encore or Wynn. I reserved a car at (what I thought) was Encore, waited in a long line only to find out that my car was at Wynn.",

        "content": "We are a couple in our late 20's early 30's who stayed at Encore in September 2011 for a week for our honeymoon in a standard Resort Suite. We requested a strip view room on check-in and got a room on the 30th floor (I think). Due to the curve of the building our room was the closest to the strip in the Resort side of the floor and we had a fantastic view down the strip including Treasure Island, Mirage and Caesars. We could watch the Mirage volcano from our room. The room was large with a comfortable couch and lovely bed. The bathroom was enormous. The pool was pretty quiet but had excellent service with waitresses constantly coming around with complimentary fruit bowls and taking drinks orders. Service was excellent and all members of staff that we dealt with, from receptionists to dealers to cleaners were all very friendly. We got turn-down service one night even though we didnt request it and then someone else tried to do it on the same night!! The room was cleaned everyday and all common areas of the hotel were very clean at all times. The casino is fairly small and quiet compared to some other resorts but the dealers were excellent. The casino is also pretty light which is a nice change from some of the dark ones elsewhere on the strip. The hotel is located to the north of the strip next door to Wynn across from Fashion Show Mall and close to Venetian/Palazzo, Treasure Island and Mirage. We had no issues with the location and could comfortably walk anywhere that we wanted to go on the strip. Although we could hear the bass from the Beach Club it didnt prevent us from sleeping at all. This hotel is easily the best hotel that I have ever stayed in and would gladly recommend it to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

        "content": "Planned a nice mother-daughter trip to Vegas. Usually stay at the Wynn but the prices for the Encore were much better and I like that the casino is much quieter there. Going to bed the first night at 1 AM I could hear people partying in the next room loudly, eventually they quieted or went out for the night. The sound seemed to come through the windows room to room on the 60-something floor and it was nothing I had experienced at any other Vegas hotel. At 7 AM the room that backed up to my bed (a different room) was blasting electronic dance music that I thought I was at a rave. The people were screaming and dancing and jumping on the beds. I called hotel security who quieted them briefly before they started up again. I called to complain again and was told my the operator that this is Vegas and I should expect noise. Yeah, maybe in the hallway baby, not a crackhead rave party in my room, especially not at that hour! Later that day I went to the front desk and my room was moved. First of all, the Encore is a nice, high-end hotel (for Vegas). I expect both higher-end guests and higher-end treatment. Secondly, I don't understand why I had to be inconvenienced and move when the guests on both sides of my room where clearly inappropriate. For this inconvenience the hotel gave me a $75 credit, they should've comped the room for the night or at the very least given a major upgrade when I moved. The reason I am giving the hotel 4 instead of 3 stars is that all the restaurants serve Vegan food which is delicious and a treat when you can get it without complaint in high-end restaurants. Also, the hotel and the hotel rooms are very nice. However, the management staff has a lot to learn about treating clients.",

What ever happened to \"customers first\" in the hospitality industry?!

Located at the end of the boulevard made this resort quieter than most which I liked, and it was very easy to maneuver around in. The connection under ground to The Wynn through the shopping mall is awesome! The cleaning service, concierge, front desk,, wait staff were all very courteous and prompt. Room service was the only slow service we encountered. Our room overlooked the pool toward the strip and the only con was that we could heard the nightclub music and people yelling even from the 23rd floor. If this would keep you awake get a room facing the mountains on opposite side of hotel. We will definitely stay here again!!",

Even the seats to play the slot machines were more comfortable than other casinos. Everything is clean and still feels new. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows, A separate seating area with a work table and couch. The TV sits in between the bed room and sitting area and it swings around so you can see it in either room. Small TV in a huge bathroom. Soaking tub and separate shower. Probably the best room I have been in Vegas.",

Although on the boundaries towards no \"mans land\" and the deserted end of the strip its still in a good position and close to the other hotels and fashion show mall. We had a strip view on the 51st floor and views were pretty awesome! The suites are large, airy and tastefully decorated, the bed far too comfy and the bathroom had huge shower room, bath, 2 sinks and still big enough to hold a small party in! The 2 pools that we found were beautiful and got a lot of sun throughout the day. Free pool towel rental and comfy beds awaited. The pool also opened at 9am so you didnt get greedy sunbathers saving the \"good beds\" before sunrise! Also drink service was frequent plus free pots of grapes not necessary but such a lovely touch. The hotel itself was grande and beautiful inside it had a large open casino floor with assortment of games and croupiers very friendly. The restuarants we visited were all very wonderful in their own right and sadly due to so much choice we did not get time to eat in all those we wanted. Shops were very high end fashion Prada, Gucci, Oscar de la renta, Tiffany etc but nice to have there if you win have a big win! I love Vegas, have been many times before and I would put Encore up there with my favorite of hotels to stay in. Encore is a good name. Steve Wynn has done well",

        "content": "Stayed here on honeymoon in June 2011 and, despite United Airlines doing their best to ruin our stay by cancelling our flight and costing us a day and a night in Vegas (never again), the pure opulence and wonderful staff made our stay an amazing experience. We stayed in a tower suite (got it on tripadvisor - rates for about $325/night AUD) and it was beautiful, complete with strip and pool view and electronic everything. From the tv to the blinds it is all remote controlled, you almost don't want to leave the room! We did however and found the shopping (although a little pricy, but hey it is a top line Vegas Casino after all), the grounds/pools and the restaurants were all unbelievable. The only slight downside I will say is that the casino is mainly for big players it seems (high table minimums) and lacks a little atmosphere, but I must say we are not big gamblers and were happy to stay on the slots, where we were always looked after with a constant supply of drinks (much better service than other casinos in Vegas I have experienced). The major bonus of staying in the hotel we found however was VIP entry into all of the Wynns night and day spots, the Sunday pool party is a must and the highlight of our stay. Overall I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone, but I would caution it is not for those on a budget.",

I have asthma so it was great not having to choke every time I go through the door. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. It's not a themed hotel but the decorations are exquisite, love the red & butterflies! Our room is extremely comfortable, very spacious and spotlessly clean. Great tolietry items as well. Pools were good, we can always find suntanning beds and the pools are not too crowded. They provide iced water nearby. We had a massage at the spa and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. You've got to splurge because it's the best massage I've ever had. We ended up being at the spa all afternoon because we couldn't bear to leave. Only a couple of downsides: Location is far from everything else as it's at the end of the strip. Also service is not very personal. I was there with a few friends to celebrate us turning 30 this year, I had emailed Encore in advance to see if they would make our special trip more special (usually hotels offer upgrades etc) but they never responded nor did they do anything special. My friends who stayed at Mandarin Oriental at the same trip was treated with birthday cake, fruits and personal cards. Not huge problem though as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend it if you don't mind a longer walk.",

        "content": "As the third and final instalment of our honeymoon we decided to spend a week in Vegas.  We've been before, staying in the Paris hotel - but as it was a special occasion, Encore was the hotel of choice.  We flew in from Hawaii and got to the hotel at about 1am Vegas time. There were 3 staff on the reception desk, and no queue. The girl was very nice, and when she read 'honeymoon' on the paperwork, she upgraded us to a suite on the 58th floor.  The room was stunning, and the view down the strip at night was amazing from so high up. It wasn't until the morning I could see a huge empty golf course on the left, and numerous swimming pools! It was a huge room, beautifully decorated and even had remote control curtains!  The TV in the bathroom didn't work, but as we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't care.  Once we'd unpacked, we decided to have a brief 'explore' as we were hungry. We found a small shop in the hotel that sold sandwiches and drinks - so bought some stuff. A sandwich, 2 bags of crisps, 2 bottles of juice, a bottle of water and an ice cream mars bar - $38! At that point we decided to avoid the hotel shop and get 'supplies' elsewhere! We went to the pool on a couple of occasions. It was really nice and had plenty of loungers available. They gave you towels, and often handed out bottles of water. There were also water dispensers around the pool too.  With the 115degreesF temperature at the time, I guess they wanted to keep everyone hydrated.  We ate in Switch restaurant in the hotel which was one of the best meals I've ever had. The food was divine and the setting is amazing. It was probably the most expensive meal we ate in Vegas, but it was worth every penny. (approx $240 for 2 mains, 2 deserts and a few drinks).  We also ate at the pizza cafe in the hotel which was lovely and pretty cheap.  The duelling pianos bar was really cool, but you HAD TO purchase at least a drink each before they'd let you in! $30+ for a beer and a cosmo!  We discovered the best way to drink in the hotel was to play slot machines - as you don't have to pay (just a tip to the waitress). That way, the $30+ rounds cost $5 each! Our plane had a huge delay on it, and we ended up staying an extra night (which BA paid for - thanks!). The staff were really helpful when sorting it out, and even gave us our better room at the standard rate.  As we'd originally booked a package we didn't know about the 'resort fee' - but on our extra night we had to pay it. The benefit of paying the 'resort fee' is that you get free wifi.  Although the hotel is on the strip, it's maybe a bit far away from most things. It's a fair walk to some of the other hotels since it's located quite far up the strip. It's good for the Fashion Show Mall - which is a 5 min walk. If I return to Vegas I'd probably try and stay somewhere nearer the middle of the strip so that I have easy access to all the hotels / casinos.   On certain days they have a Beach Club - which is essentially a night club during the day. We never attended - but it was a nightmare trying to get a taxi at 6pm as there were hundreds of drunk youngsters trying to get home. We stood in line for about 25mins - which made us late for our restaurant reservation. We also went to get a taxi at 4am to go home... just as the Surrender nightclub had come out. Thankfully the doormen had the sense to let us skip the queue since we had 4 suitcases! Although we were on the 58th floor, we could hear the music from Surrender when in bed. In summary, Encore is an stunning hotel. It's beautiful both inside and out, and the staff are brilliant. It does come at a price though! Would I go back - probably not. I'd rather try somewhere else a bit more central... However I would recommend it for a one off.",

I have stayed at many wonderful hotels, but the Encore by Wynn was just wonderful on every level! I loved the \"suite\" feature of all of the Encore rooms and the bathroom was HUGE. Beautiful linens, room spotlessly clean, excellent amenities. I liked the fact that we were on the North end of the strip, and could get away from the noise and the crowds. We like to walk and had no problem navigating the rest of the strip. After visiting almost every hotel on the strip, we definitely made the right choice. Wonderful staff as well - the concierge was great securing reservations and even just making recommendations. We ate at several of the restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed every meal. Pricey, like all of Vegas, but excellent with top notch service. Love the shopping within the Wynn complex as well! Especially the Manolo Blahnik store! Hands down, the best place we've ever stayed and we will be back. Worth every penny.",

We stayed on the 60th floor with an awesome view of the strip.   Something I realized this trip is that there are no casinos or hotels in Vegas that even compare to the Wynn.   It was so nice to see such a clean resort with fresh flowers placed throughout it daily.  No one else does the little things like that.  Not even the newer Aria has anything to compare.  Now, even as a big fan of the Wynn, here's  a couple of things I disliked... We arrived on Thursday to a partially empty casino, it was awesome!! Not a lot of smoke, not a lot of people and we were actually winning money!! Everyone was happy... This was short lived because as soon as Friday arrived EVERYTHING changed. Like a switch was switched..  I guess the pro's arrived and took over.  The place became super packed, the smokers arrived in herds and I lost all the money I had won, plus some.  I know, I know - it's a casino, duh...but I think the next time I go I'll try to go during the week with the other amateurs.   Oh and another helpful tip,  park on the top floor, level 4 if you get a car rental..  It's a lot cooler with plenty of parking.  Unlike the other $@!#% casinos, the Wynn makes parking and entering the resort a breeze.   Love the koi ponds they have at the entrances to their uber elite villas.  I always love to go there and just hang out for a few minutes, so very refreshing.  Thanks Wynn, <3 you for being the best!",

        "content": "We are not high rollers by any means but we still received two comped nights at the Wynn with an upgrade to the King Resort Suite at the Encore and paid for a third night. The normal rates for the Wynn or Encore are out of our Las Vegas traveling budget so we were thrilled with the offer. Would I stay again, free or not, probably not? I suppose the pros and cons will intermingle here. The casino décor is really, really red and somewhat gaudy. It is very different from the Wynn or the Bellagio that Steve Wynn built. The room is nice with plenty of space for personal belongings but not as big as it appears on the website. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Although there are outlets by the bed they are taken by the rooms “gadgets” so I just unplugged the lamps. Speaking of gadgets, the control for the curtains is on the bedside table, is not illuminated, so when I wanted to open the curtains in the morning for a just bit of light I had to stumble around with the control and subsequently woke my husband. The honor bar had a variety of choices that I personally found to be exorbitant e.g. 5$ for a 12 oz can of soda and 8$ for a tin of Reese's Pieces. The wifi is included in the 20$ a night resort fee and there was a printer/fax machine in the suite; the fax has a cost to it but I do not know about the printer itself. The bathroom is spacious and the amenities very nice such as shoe polish, cotton balls, q-tips. The shampoo, shower gel etc. was much larger than the standard hotel and is lemon grass fragranced. The towels were very thick and plentiful and there are robes too. There is a ledge that allows plenty of room for personal items without cluttering the counter top. On the down side the bathroom does not have much room to hang anything including a hand towel and the bathtub is short! My husband, who is 6’1 and can stretch out comfortably in our normal size home tub, had to scrunch his knees up in the Encore room tub. I also found it weird that the water controls are on the back not to the side or front of tub. The line at check in wasn’t long and there was plenty of staff but still took longer than it should have in my experience. The staff we encountered were all very courteous and would actually hold/start a conversation. Housekeeping during our stay was excellent everything was put back in order just as the moment we arrived; although with being in a hotel of this caliber right after we checked in I was shocked to find a hairball behind the bathroom door (which was cleaned up the next day). We did use one of the pools at the Encore and had a good time; it was not the one with the bar or the beach club. This pool was easy to access from the elevators just off the casino floor and was a mix of people. We brought in our own drinks in a non-breakable cup they also had ice water readily available throughout the pool area. There were limited shaded areas. Ok after all this rambling why would I not stay there again. I suppose it is all location and incidental costs for me. I felt very disconnected from the rest of the strip; it is an easy walk to the Venetian but not much else. I like to be more centralized where I have more options for gambling and food choices. Perhaps for many who may stay at this property this is not a huge issue but there was nowhere that I found to “grab a quick (inexpensive) bite” or table games less than a 25$ minimum. I have stayed on the strip in a room just as nice , with a great pool, coffee maker, refrigerator and a nicer view for a lot less money.",

        "content": "The hotel is stunning to look at. Check in was very quick. We arrived after 9pm on a Friday and were offered either the 17th floor strip side or the 37 floor on the quiet side. We chose quiet, the view was high enough that you could avoid looking at the partial construction site and look at the mountains or Wynn golf course. At night we had a view of the city lights, Stratosphere, Circus Circus. Our room looked very much like the website pictures, except that I believe our room was an accessable room. There was not a private toilet room, so having this big giant bathroom was pointless for those of us who like a little privacy. The towels were a bit grungy (looked like someone had mopped up mud with them and it didn't all come out in the wash), hair in the tub, dust on the crooked lamps in the bathroom, hearing neighboring room's noise - is not a five star hotel in my opinion. Details like a second box of kleenex outside of the bathroom, a second set of hooks to hang things in the bathroom (as ours were maybe 3 feet from the floor, and our closet had low shelves, so there was no place to hang anything longer than a shirt) were also missed. The bed was pure comfort. Each morning we went to the adult pool and pressed the button as we left for housekeeping. Our room was always ready when we returned. We ate at several of the casual restaurants for breakfast and lunch. For small meals, the pizza place on the Wynn side was great to grab a slice from (lovely to eat outside by the waterfalls) or the lobby bar at Encore. We tried Stratta before LeReve. The meal was fantastic, but too much food. I must have mentioned when I purchased tickets for LeReve that is was for my husband's birthday; because our server at Stratta brought out a georgeous little dessert cake and candle at the end of our meal. We are not gamblers. We visit Vegas for relaxing, shows, restaurants and shopping. We'd spend a little at the quarter slots before heading to our room each night. The drink service was quick. I enjoyed the wine they served in the casino more than the glass I had at Stratta. We enjoyed our stay at Encore, the casino, pool, restaurants and shops are luxury. I was a bit disappointed with our room; perhaps my expectations were too high, but there were details that they missed. On our next trip it will be a hard decision whether to stay at the Encore or return to the Palazzo (loved the bathroom at Palazzo with the seperate vanity table).",

(both were excellent!!)..the first day we went to the encore pool (the adult area) and found it to be rather crowded and noisy with lots of loud music not really my taste, and a younger crowd having a great time..that was good for them, but i was really looking for something a little more sedate and relaxing...the next day we found that at the wynn adult pool.. lots of open chairs and much less of a party atmosphere with better (in my opinion ) music..it was a good walk but well worth it..nearby is the fashion mall that has a fairly good selection of fast food for when you dont feel like spending a fortune to eat. the room was really nice and we had a great view at night.. the daytime view was marred a bit by the fact that it squarely overlooked the unfinished casino that was 1/4 built..the shampoos and soaps were really nice and the robes for us was a nice touch too..we brought our own coffee pot as that is not in the room and i didnt feel like going downstairs for a $5 cup of coffee first thing in the morning..really it would be so nice to add a coffee pot in the rooms.. or at least have an option.. i did enjoy the no smoking policy.. all in all a good experience with good service..",

        "content": "You haven't done Vegas until you stay at The Encore or the Wynn. I went for a bachelor party with my friends for a weekend and had an awesome time. We've stayed at other resorts before on prevous trips, but this was all about the experience. You don't need to worry about finding the hot spot, because its at either the Wynn or Encore every night. We stayed at The Encore, but it is connected to the Wynn, and from what I could tell the amenities are the same. It is 5 star service all the way. You feel like a celebrity or royalty when you are there. And you will probably see a few while you are there. I highly recommend spending some extra bucks if you are attending the night clubs or pool party and get table service, or a cabana. It is much more enjoyable this way... and hey your in Vegas. For dining, there are many options and all of the restarants are fabulous. My favorite place, and if you are in the mood for a steak, get a reservation at Botero. Get a few side's to share around the table, as these are not your normal side dishes. Get the Mac n Cheese, and trust me this is no box stuff. The staff at the hotel was beyond expectations. The rooms are large, and immaculate. Beds are very comfortable, and when you go home, you are going to want to redo your bathroom to mimic your stay at Encore. I've never spent so much time in the bathroom. If you are doing some gambling don't be shy with your players card. You can talk to the concierge and get some extras with all of your play. This is the best hotel in Vegas, no question. My only regret is I didn't get a spa appointment. I guess I'll have something new to try next time!",

Mini suite layout was lovely and the bathrooms in particular are great. Pool area was excellent, good waitress service, nice laid back atmosphere and really appreciated the adults only pool so you could properly relax with no kids running around! Hotel is beautiful, very bright and airy, I liked that encore was smaller than the Wynn side, it felt much more intimate and laid back. The location is right at the north end of the strip (assuming you dont go up to circus circus - not sure why you would really) but thats not a problem if you dont mind a bit of walking. We also ate at Okada in the Wynn which was fantastic, while I didnt particularly enjoy the Society cafe in the Encore, there wasnt anything wrong as such, just a little slow and a bit dull, not the best breakfast we had in vegas- Peppermill wins on that one! The concierge was fantastic and helped us to check in online for the flights etc, on the whole a fantastic stay, I would definitely reccommend Encore.",

        "content": "My husband and I booked our honeymoon through travelocity to stay at Paradise Point Resort and Spa. I was a little nervous because when we normally book trips on-line, we are somewhat familiar with the city and hotels. For this trip we had to total trust customer reviews and the hotel website pictures because neither of us had been to San Diego before or heard of Paradise Point Resort. We got a great rate, and upon arriving at the hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. When I happen to mention in passing that it was our honeymoon, they upgraded our room (even though we had pre-paid through travelocity). Throughout our stay they were accomodating of our needs and extremely helpful with suggesting restaurants, local attractions, etc. We enjoyed our guest room and found it very comfortable and cozy. We had a suite that you walked directly into from the driveway, and it had a private patio with a little creek behind it. It was very relaxing and very different from a traditional hotel experience. The location was great too. We rented a car and found it very easy to get around San Diego and its surrounding areas. It would only take between 2-10minutes to get anywhere, even downtown. And, our room had a parking spot right next to the door, so parking was extremely convenient. Although we were spending our honeymoon there, we were also impressed with how family friendly Paradise Point is (yet, we didn't feel over run by kids- definitely a plus for newlyweds just wanting to spend some quality-quiet time together for their honeymoon). We feel as though when we have a family we would definitely go back and stay there. Overall, Paradise Point was a great experience that I would recommend to family, friends, colleagues and anyone else. The pictures that you see on-line are a true representation of what you see and experience when you get there. I would go back in a minute and as my husband says....that means/says a lot considering that I am a picky traveler when it comes to cleanliness, comfort, and quality :)",

The pools were lovely. The Bare Foot Bar and Grill was a pleasure. The employees were wonderful. The bellman took his time with us, and gave us plenty of suggestions of places to go and things to do. The young lady at the front desk made sure our room was ready within half an hour, even though we were there 3 hours before check in. I'm a New Yorker through and through and would never have thought there would be another place on Earth that I'd be willing to live. But, San Diego is extremely alluring. The city is beautiful, clean, and has tons of restaurants, I never felt overcrowded, or rushed. Between the dog friendly Balboa Park with all it's museums, the incredible San Diego Zoo, Hip Pacific Bay, the mountains in the distance, and the very chilly but beautiful Pacific, give me seven more years, and I may be looking for a transfer.",

        "content": "Just got back from a 5 day stay at Paradise Point and here is my plus and minus review. Plus side Great location, Easy driving distance from the airport, Sea World, Old Town San Diego (great restaurants in Old Town), parks etc. The resort feels very lush with many pools to choose from, and the fire pits are a nice touch. Staff was helpful with directions and at check-in. (your on your own getting to your room) The Negatives: Stayed in room 158, the beds are the worst I've ever slept on. The beds in the room need to be replaced, they are saggy, and every time you moved the springs creaked like a cheap motel 6 bed. (Wife and I had the worst sleep ever on a bed here) As mentioned from a previous reader, resort is quite large and when we checked in, we got a map and basically had to fend for yourself to find the room. It was kinda funny watching people wander around looking for their room especially at night when its dark at the resort. Not cool. Their high end restaurant (Baleen) is way over priced and average food. Wife ordered the steak and I had the halibut dish. Both were very salty. This is to bad since the location is lovely and the waiter was nice. Their other restaurant (Barefoot) has okay, breakfast food nothing special, their dinner wasn't great. Again nice location. The waiter/waitresses were average Paying $25.00 per day for parking and $9.95 per day for slow internet is ridiculous. Isn't the rooms expensive enough?? My one major recommendation if you stay in their garden view rooms is request a room that isn't facing the road around the resort. Ask for the rooms that you have to park and walk around the building,they are facing the ponds, grass etc. They are a lot quieter.",

        "content": "I stayed at Paradise Point last weekend for the 2010 Bayfair Airguard Championship Unlimited Hydroplane Race. Because I was on an extremely tight time frame, I needed help leaving Sunday after the race. I called the concierge, Elizabeth Markling. She made certain that my airline boarding passes were printed accurately as there was some misinformation from Alaska Airlines. Elizabeth handled this, going the extra mile to double check the tickets. I needed a cab waiting for me at 4:45 and it rolled up right at 4:45! She also made sure that I knew which terminal the commuter airline used, so I wouldn't miss my flight. During the entire process, Elizabeth was courteous and was concerned that my Paradise Point experience would be great! Thanks to her dedication, the experience was wonderful. That's why I refer to her as the \"World's Best Employee!\"",

        "content": "My husband and I just returned home from an 8 night stay at Paradise Point. We live in San Diego and have stayed in many hotels/resorts on Mission Bay within the past 2 years. This was our favorite. The hotel staff was exceedingly helpful and friendly (every single one of them). The room (a bayside 1 bedroom bungalow) was clean, roomy, stylish and very comfortable - with a gorgeous view of the bay and bridge. The property is expansive with many beautiful paths and lagoons to enjoy. The public parks that border the resort are equally lovely and offer endless places to just sit and relax and gaze at the bay. For half our stay we were joined by our extended family. All were as pleased as we were with their rooms (basic lanai and not on the bay) and with their experience as whole - including our 2 young grandchildren. It is pricey but no more so than other San Diego resorts. We booked 4 nights for the price of 3 (still available at the time of this review) and felt we got our money's worth (we stayed 8 nights for the price of 6). The restaurant (the least expensive of the two) was actually very well-priced for a resort; although the menu seemed somewhat limited. Reading some of the other reviews, I'm truly mystified. I can't imagine what more anyone would want from a resort, or a vacation. It was a perfectly wonderful experience from the first through the last day. We will be returning soon.",

        "content": "Stayed here for a conference and although initally driving in you think, wow this place looks nice, take a better look around. It's only the gardens that look nice. The bungalows look like little dumpy cubes. They really need to improve the external look if you want to match the landscaping & cost to stay here. This place is not a quiet romantic getaway type place. It is located within walking distance of Sea World, so you have a TON of family/kids, and if your prepared for that then you can go in knowing the noise level will be annoying. Having an adult only pool doesn't work, because you always have the losers that bring their kids here to get away from the other noisy kids elsewhere. No hotel staff around to let them know-adults only!! Many places like this are overrated. It is so frustrating to pay and arm and a leg to stay in a place like this, and then they turn around a charge you more for everything you want to do. $12.00 a day to use the workout room, parking fees, fees to use the tennis court. etc. etc. Are you serious? I don't call that a vacation when your raked over the coals everytime you want to do something \"extra\". Maybe for some this is \"fun\". For me I'd rather stay in a nice chain hotel that appreciates their guests. Spending more doesn't make it memorable, but if you don't mind opening up your wallet to be drained......this is the place for you.For me it was overrated, really don't have an interest in staying here again.",

        "content": "Okay, let's start out with the good... beautiful grounds include a lagoon, bridges, tropical plants, nice pools, clean and updated rooms. They had campfires on the beach in the evening with tiki torches lighting the area. Very nice. However, even with all this good, my biggest complaint is thin walls. I don't want to hear the party next door, and I did, on both sides. Luckily, we got a decent crowd on both sides and they went to bed at decent hours and they were not partiers. I would predict however, some people would encounter these issues. They can fix cosmetic or other easier fixable items, but adding more insulation to their newly decorated rooms will not happen easily. There is a $25 parking fee to park your car, right outside your room and the bar and grill is pricey ($14) for order of nachos. We ate appetizers, two beers and one iced tea and our bill was $80. However the view was gorgeous, so your paying for the ambiance. It's very close to sea world and right next to Mission Bay Park, so location is wonderful. Beds were comfy. Rooms newly decorated and very clean. I would recommend, but warn friends of the thin walls.",

It offers great package deals (be sure to sign up on their email list for last-minute specials). Unlike most hotels in the area, this hotel is well built and the rooms offer privacy, peace, and quiet. We never hear our neighbors. The staff members are courteous and always go out of their way to help you. The mall is great fun and offers an eclectic blend of stores. Be sure to ask for a coupon book at guest services--great deals in there. The hotel bar/restaurant has great specials--like 2 for 1 drinks and appetizers--much cheaper and far more enjoyable than eating in the food court. Several conferences going on each time we stayed--the patrons were all very happy with the conference amenities too. We'd definitely go again for business or pleasure",

There is also a very nice pool, weather permitting, as it is outside! I heard there is also a very nice gym which I did not visit. A colleague had some trouble with no bottled water being supplied in her room but this was easily resolved by the reception staff. While there we also asked the staff for some details regarding local bus services, and they have a useful print-out showing you the bus routes to get to all the local attractions. The reception staff were very helpful indeed about this. High speed wireless is also available for free in the lobby which was great. Ordered room service while there and it was very nice, well presented and tasty. They also followed it up with a call to check everything was okay which was nice. The only annoying thing about this hotel is the staff constantley asking you to fill out feedback cards about them! We were only there 2 nights and ended up doing about 8 or 10 of them! Apart from that i loved this hotel and it's easy access to the mall, stay there!",

From rude staff to registration mix-ups, my experience has taught me to start a new hotel relationship with extreme caution. However, from the moment I began working with Jessica and her team at the Florida Hotel & Conference Center, I could tell this was going to be different. The sales staff was friendly, knew their stuff and very responsive. Barry stepped in beautifully even while Jessica was away so we could keep our planning on schedule. They were very flexible with my rooming and event needs and never made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. I had unconventional room layout needs and they were more than willing to work with me on those. Coordinating 350 people from 22 states into 2 days was not easy, but they make it look that way. The banquets team was also especially helpful, not making us wait more than a few minutes to follow through on room changes. Kudos to Verna for running such a sharp and well run machine! My only regret is that this team canâ€™t follow us when we do events in other states! All hotels can learn much from the open communication, friendliness and commitment to customer satisfaction that the Florida Hotel & Conference Center Team have. If youâ€™re planning an event and want it to be a success, make them your first choice.",

Apart from its central location to all the main attractions and shopping, I find this hotel to be one of the best in Florida and why?? The staff are just absolutely wonderful. They just cannot do enough for you to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I stay at this hotel at least once a week and the staff make you feel as though it is your first time staying there. So jovial and amazingly friendly without being over the top. For value for money, amenieties and friendliness of the staff. I vote this one No.1 in Florida. You will not be dissappointed in any way if you stay at this hotel.",

The Hotel was very nice and very clean except when childen would come down for popcorn and spill it all over the floor. Our room was lovely except we had to have the blankets changed!!!!!!! We always take a black light with us to check for dirty linens and it paid off. The staff took care of the problem right away. Thank you very much.... All and all we will be staying there again but I will have my black light in hand!!!!!",

        "content": "As a newer hotel that's close to the corporate offices of a business I visit regularly, I was excited to stay here for the first time last month. The hotel gets very high marks for staff enthusiasm, courtesy, friendlieness, and helpfulness. Being a newer hotel, it was spotlessly clean. I liked the breakfast area, although it did get a bit noisy when the \"rush\" hit about 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. The room was similarly clean and comfortable. The wireless internet connection (free) was useful. I also liked their simply-put, straight-forward internet privacy policy (\"You have no expectation of privacy...). No beating around the bush there--wish others would spare us the jibberish and just come out and say what is obvious: on an unsecured, free wireless internet network connection, you don't have any privacy! There was just one problem, and I discovered later that a colleague who has stayed here twice experienced both times on this visit. I did not get my wake-up call, which made me late for a meeting. That is unaccetable, especially when I asked the front desk about the reliability of their wake-up calls. My back-up system for awakening (the hotel's very cheap alarm clocks) proved equally inadequate. The alarm did go off, but was so quiet that it couldn't be heard and didn't do the job. I'm not that heavy of a sleeper, either! It may be a little problem to some, but it's enough to put them on my \"one more chance\" list. I'd like to stay here again.",
