 Gina![Gina I/O](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rhinostone/gina/master/core/asset/img/favicon-16x16.png)   

>  Gina was designed to be accessible, flexible, scalable and maintainable. Our main purpose was to allow developers to create easier and faster web applications.
>  
> Essential features are available at this moment, but most of the things we don't have yet can be replaced by some alternatives written in other languages like: Ruby, PHP, .net, Python or C++. You are free to use such alternatives until we implement similar features.   



## Compatibility

__Gina works fine with the following versions of Node.js:__
- `v8.x.x`,
- `v7.x.x`,
- `v6.x.x` (Between Node.js 5.x and 6.3, NPM is broken, use manual installation: by cloning),
- `v5.x.x` (Between Node.js 5.x and 6.3, NPM is broken, use manual installation: by cloning),
- `v4.x.x`,
- `v0.12.x`, 
- `v0.11.x`,
- `v0.10.x`


## Getting started with Gina I/O

### Initializing a project
Let's create our first project and install Gina.   
Type everything after the __`$`__

``` tty
$ mkdir myproject
```

``` tty
$ cd myproject
```

You can now install the framework using npm:

```  tty
$ npm install gina@latest
```
**OR by cloning (manual installation)**
```tty
$ mkdir node_modules
$ mkdir node_modules/gina
$ git clone https://github.com/Rhinostone/gina.git ./node_modules/gina
$ node ./node_modules/gina/script/post_install.js
```

Then you need to __initialize your project__

> On macOS or on Linux

```  tty
$ ./gina.sh -i myproject
```

> on Windows from the Windows CLI - __YOU NEED TO BE ADMIN !!__

```  tty
$ gina -i myproject
```


__NB:__ All gina commands are launched from the project root.

### Creating a bundle (application)

A project is a set of bundles. Gina lets you create all kinds of bundles :
* API & web services
* Frontend & backend applications
* Command lines

Note that the default bundle type is API.

> OK. Now let's do it !

``` tty
$ ./gina.sh -a frontend
```

We have just created a frontend application that will host our homepage.
You will find all bundle sources under `myproject/src`.

You can start the bundle with the following command:

```tty
$ ./gina.sh -s frontend dev
```
Now, visit http://127.0.0.1:3100/  to check your homepage.
Isn't it sexy !?

If you need to stop it, just hit `ctrl+c`.


### Adding views

The default bundle renders a JSON representation of a "Hello World" message.

Let's add views on our frontend

```tty
$ ./gina.sh -av frontend
```
Now edit the `init` action in `src/frontend/controllers/controller.js` so that you can have `self.render(...)` instead of `self.renderJSON(...)`

Once it's done, you just need to refresh your browser.

Gina is shipped with [Swig](http://node-swig.github.io/swig-templates/docs/) as the default template engine. If you are more comfortable with another template engine, you can use your own.

## Debugging in Gina

You can attach a remote debugger like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to Gina.

1. Open your project   
![New window](./documentation/img/debug-new1.png)   
![New window](./documentation/img/debug-new2.png)   
2. Click to the `Debug` tab   
![New conf](./documentation/img/debug-conf1.png)   
3. Open your configuration file and select `Node.js`   
![New conf](./documentation/img/debug-conf2.png)   
![New conf](./documentation/img/debug-conf3.png)   
4. Select `Attach` and clean your configuration   
![New conf](./documentation/img/debug-conf4.png)   
![New conf](./documentation/img/debug-conf5.png)   
5. Change the __port number__ to match the one you will be listening from Gina (e.g.: `5959`)   
![New conf](./documentation/img/debug-conf6.png)   

6. Save, and go back to your terminal to start your bundle with the debug argument:
Before Node.js `v8.x.x`
```tty 
$ ./gina.sh -s frontend dev --debug-brk=5959
```
After Node.js `v8.x.x`
```tty 
$ ./gina.sh -s frontend dev --inspect-brk=5959
```
> Gina will be waiting for you to launch the remote debugger.

7. Launch your remote debugger & have fun !

## Troubleshooting

### I can't start my bundle

__Are you starting for the first time ?__

- If you are a __Windows user__, make sure you are running your command line with sufficient permission; like __"launching your terminal as administrator"__.


- If you have just cloned Gina from github, don't forget to run from the project root :
```tty
$ node node_modules/gina/script/post_install.js
```

- Have you noticed the __environment argument__ ( dev ) ?
``` tty
$ ./gina.sh -s frontend dev
```
Without the __dev__ argument, Gina is going to understand that you want to use the production environment. If it's really what you want to achieve, just __build__ :
```tty
$ ./gina.sh -b frontend prod
```
NB.: `prod` is optional here; if you don't add it, it will build for prod by default.


__Are you trying to restart after a crash ?__

Gina uses 2 processes today: one master, one slave (it will change very soon). Once an exception is thrown and the program crashes, one of the 2 processes can remain in the `tasks/processes` list.
This has been mostly observed for Windows users.

- If you are on a POSIX OS, you should look for `gina`, then kill it !

- If you are on a Windows, look for `node.exe` or  `Event I/O Handler`, then kill it !

After this, try again to start, it should run better.

### I can't re install Gina

__Are you trying to reinstall from the project root ?__

- Go to your project root (where you can see `env.json` & `project.json`)
- Remove the file `gina`. This bug is related to npm since Node 0.12.x and only found on POSIX Operating Systems
``` tty
$ rm ./gina
```
- You can now reinstall
``` tty
$ npm install gina
```
