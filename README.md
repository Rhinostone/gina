Node.js MVC framework with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) 2.7.2 — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` or per-section `"ext": ".njk"` |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — Node.js process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

## What's in 0.5.3

- **Released-response crash family finished (bundle-killing).** The two remaining members are now guarded: a late `self.throwError(statusCode, error)` in its two- and three-argument forms (only the single-argument form was guarded before), and the HTML render delegates (swig and nunjucks, including their async variants) invoked after the response was already released. Both now log-and-ignore or no-op instead of dereferencing the released response — no `uncaughtException`, no SIGTERM, no unhandled promise rejection — matching `renderJSON()` and the streaming delegate.
- **Atomic `~/.gina` state-file writes.** The five state files (`main.json`, `projects.json`, `settings.json`, `env.json`, `locals.json`) are now written via a temp file plus rename, so a concurrent boot of many bundles or containers against the same home directory can no longer read a partially-written file and crash on startup.
- **Framework command-socket hardening.** The command socket now accumulates each connection's payload and parses it only once complete; a malformed, partial, or non-JSON payload is ignored instead of throwing an uncaught exception that could drop the command or shut the framework down.
- **Framework socket port no longer corrupted by bundle flags.** A sub-topic command passed `--port` (e.g. `gina port:set`, `gina bundle:start`) no longer overwrites the framework socket port in `~/.gina/<short>/settings.json` — which previously made later online commands fail with `[ gina ] not started`. The framework-connection flags (`--port`, `--mq-port`, `--host-v4`, `--hostname`, `--debug-port`) now apply as framework settings only for framework-scoped commands.
- **Boot failures surface their cause.** The `gina-container` launcher and the framework boot path now flush the failure reason synchronously before `process.exit`, so a crash on a piped stdout/stderr (the norm under container log collectors) reports its cause instead of exiting with no message.
- **`gina port:set --force`.** Reassigns a port already held by another bundle (evicting the prior holder from both port maps); without `--force`, an in-use port is still rejected as before. Enables deterministic per-bundle port pinning for one-bundle-per-container deployments.
- **Storage `_id` collision hardening** (16 base-62 random suffix, matching the collection ID convention) and **clearer unresolved-`${secret:KEY}` diagnostics** (the failing key name and config path are logged at debug level; the propagated error still omits the key).
