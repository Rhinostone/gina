# Gina

<strong>Gina I/O</strong> - Node.js MVC and Event Driven framework

> This is a `preview release`. We are looking for people to help us test and improve `Windows` support.
> Some commands or features might not work since the framework is still under development & testing
> 
> We have some applications using the framework in production and we are improving our code in order to release the `1.0.0` version: which should come by the end of 2022. Thank you for your patience.

## Philosophy behind

Gina was designed to be accessible, flexible, scalable and maintainable. Our main purpose was to allow developers to create easier and faster web applications.

Gina comes with essential features at this moment, but most of the things we don't have yet can be replaced by some alternatives written in other languages like: Ruby, PHP, .net, Python or C++. You are free to use such alternatives until we implement similar features.

Note that Gina does not rely on Connect or ExpressJS, still, you can use all plugins or middlewares designed for those frameworks ;-)

## Getting started with Gina I/O

### Installing Gina
Gina aims to be at the same time a framework, a deployment and monitoring environment for your projects. So, to fully enjoy Gina, we recommend that you install it with the `-g` option.
> For Microsoft Windows, you might have to run the command line with Administrator privileges.

```  tty
npm install -g gina@latest
```

You can check if Gina is properly installed
```  tty
gina version
```
__NB.:__ This is a shortcut for `gina framework:version`


### Starting the framework
Gina is at the same time a framework and a server.
By starting the framework, you will also start the server.

``` tty
gina start
```
__NB.:__ This is an alias for `gina framework:start`

### Getting the logs
You will also get logs related to your running bundles.
``` tty
gina tail
```
__NB.:__ This is an alias for `gina framework:tail`

By default, Gina does not store logs. Logs are treated like any other envents here.
This means that you need a logger container (or transport) to receive and output your logs.
You are lucky, we have developped one that you just need to enable.
You can edit `~/.gina/user/extensions/logger/main.json` to add `file` container to the `flows`.
You might need to restart the gina :

```tty
gina restart
```

### Initializing a project
A project is a collection of bundles (applicaitons or services). See it as a representation of your domain.

Let's create our first project and install Gina.

``` tty
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
```


Then you need to __initialize your project__

> On Windows from the Windows CLI, you might need admin privileges.

```  tty
gina project:add @myproject
```

If you need to remove this project later
```  tty
gina project:rm @myproject
```

### Creating a bundle (application or service)

A project is a set of bundles. Gina lets you create all kinds of bundles :
* API & web services
* frontend & backend applications
* command lines

Note that the default bundle type is API.

Ok ! Let's do it !

``` tty
gina bundle:add frontend @myproject
```
__NB.:__ If you are launching the command from the project directory, you don't need `@myproject`. The same goes for all bundles commands.

We have just created a frontend application that will host our homepage.
You will find all bundle sources under `myproject/src`.

You can start the bundle with the following command:

```tty
gina bundle:start frontend @myproject
```


Now, visit http://127.0.0.1:3100/  to check your homepage.
Isn't it sexy !?

If you need to stop your bundle
```tty
gina bundle:stop frontend @myproject
```

If you need to restart you bundle
```tty
gina bundle:restart frontend @myproject
```

### Adding templates

The default bundle renders a JSON representation of a "Hello World" message.

Let's add a view on our frontend

```tty
gina view:add frontend @myproject
```
Then restart your bundle
```tty
gina bundle:restart frontend @myproject
```

Now edit the `home` control in `src/frontend/controllers/controller.js` so that you can have `self.render(...)` instead of `self.renderJSON(...)`

Once it's done, you just need to refresh your browser.

Gina is shipped with [Swig](https://node-swig.github.io/swig-templates/) as the default template engine. If you are more comfortable with another template engine, you can use your own.



### Setting your default environment

Please, note that you have 2 types of environments : one for the framework, and one for your project & your bundles.

> By default, Gina (the framework) comes with 2 environments : `dev` and `prod`. The default is `prod`. if you are contributing to the framework or prototyping your application or service, we advise using the `dev` environment.
> ```tty
> gina framework:set --env=dev 
> ```

You can check which are the environments set for your projects
```tty
gina env:list
```
__or for a particular project__
```tty
gina env:list @myproject
```

__NB.:__ when adding an environement, you will do so for the entire project.

#### Setting your application starting environment on runtime
> This method does not memorize the selected environment as the default one for your application

You can have multiple environments for your project and decide to pick one as the starting env by using `--env=your_env` every time you have to run a bundle.

```tty
gina bundle:start frontend @myproject --env=prod
```
__NB.:__ Omitting `--env=<env>` will fallback to your project default environment.

#### Setting your project or your application default environment

For the entire project & for all bundles inside by default
```tty
gina env:use prod @myproject
```
__NB.:__ If you need to change it for a particular bundle, you still can do it at runtime using `--env=<your env>` to override the default settings. This will not set `<your env>`as the default environment for the whole project.


#### Other operations you can apply to your environment:
__Adding a new environment for your project__
```tty
gina env:add staging @myproject
```
__Removing an existing environment for your project__
```tty
gina env:rm staging @myproject
```

__Defining an existing environment as `development` (you can only have one like this)__
```tty
gina env:link-dev <your new dev env>
```


## Troubleshooting

### I can't start my bundle

__Are you starting for the first time ?__

- If you are a __Windows user__, make sure you are running your command line with sufficient permission; like __"launching your terminal as administrator"__.


- If you have just cloned Gina from GitHub, don't forget to run from the project root :
```tty
node node_modules/gina/script/post_install.js
```


__Are you trying to restart after a crash ?__

Before v0.1.0, Gina used 2 processes for each bundle: one master, one slave.
Once an exception is thrown and the program crashes, one of the 2 processes can remain in the `tasks/processes` list.

Gina only uses one process per bundle or one per project if you have decided to merge bundles execution.
This has been mostly observed for Windows users.

- If you are on a POSIX OS, you should look for `gina`, then kill it !

- If you are on a Windows, look for `node.exe` or  `Event I/O Handler`, then kill it !

After this, try again to start, it should run better.
