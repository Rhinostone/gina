Node.js MVC framework with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) 1.5.0 — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()` |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

## What's in 0.3.7

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) support** — `gina bundle:mcp` generates an MCP tool manifest (`mcp.json`) from `routing.json`. `gina bundle:mcp-start` runs a live MCP server over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0) that dispatches `tools/call` as real HTTP requests against the running bundle. Any Gina app is now consumable by MCP-compatible IDE and agent tooling out of the box. MCP spec revision 2025-06-18
- **Standalone Inspector SPA + dual-mode resolution** — Inspector can now run as a separate single-page app served from its own origin, with the target bundle passed as `?target=<origin>`. The dev-mode statusbar and `gina inspector:open` both resolve the URL via a 4-level fallback (`--url=` → bundle `config/settings.json > inspector.url` → `~/.gina/<shortVersion>/settings.json > inspector.url` → embedded `<target>/_gina/inspector/`), covering host-SPA + Docker-bundle splits
- **Inspector Reveal toggle** — dev-mode red-tinted toggle that swaps the redacted `__ginaData` for the unredacted snapshot via `/_gina/reveal`; only bundles running in `local` scope serve it, beta/production/testing return 403. Redactor now tokenizes camelCase so identifiers like `companyName` / `passportRequired` are no longer false-positive-redacted
- **`service:list` + `bundle:list` port and running-state columns** — both commands now show each bundle's preferred dev port and whether the process is alive, read from `~/.gina/ports.reverse.json` and `~/.gina/run/<bundle>@<project>.pid`
- **Explicit exports from `require('gina')`** — every framework-injected global (`getContext`, `_`, `requireJSON`, `merge`, …) is now also reachable as a named property on `require('gina')` / `require('gina/gna')`, with JSDoc and auto-generated `types/gna.d.ts`. Runtime globals unchanged
- See 0.3.6 for Inspector payload redaction + CORS preflight fix, and 0.3.5 for the swig 1.5.0 security extension
