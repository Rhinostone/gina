Node.js MVC framework with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) 2.7.2 — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` or per-section `"ext": ".njk"` |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — Node.js process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |
| Runtime | Node.js 22–26, or **Bun** (`bun add -g gina`) — install + boot validated end-to-end by a CI Bun smoke |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global   # or, on the Bun runtime: bun add -g gina
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

> **npm 12+** blocks install scripts by default, and gina's post-install bootstraps `~/.gina` and the framework dependencies. Install with `npm install -g gina@latest --allow-scripts=gina`, or allow it once for all global installs with `npm config set allow-scripts=gina --location=user`. (Not needed on npm ≤ 11.)

## What's in 0.5.11

- **Added — `gina image:build`: first-class OCI packaging.** Package a project bundle as a standard OCI image with one command: it synthesizes a `Containerfile` + build context from the project's registered state (bundles, entry, ports, env model, Node engine floor) and executes the build with buildah — natively on Linux, or on a container host reached over ssh (`GINA_CONTAINER_HOST=ssh://[user@]host[:port]` env override → native buildah → `container.host` in `~/.gina/<shortVersion>/settings.json`). A non-dev `--env` ships the release tree built in-image by `gina bundle:build`, so a production image never runs dev-mode hot-reload; the image boots via `gina-init` + `gina-container` (SIGTERM drain) and the `EXPOSE`d port is computed deterministically from the port allocator. `${secret:KEY}` placeholders ride byte-verbatim and resolve from the container environment at runtime — never baked. `--emit` prints the synthesized artifact without building; `--format=json` emits a one-shot machine-readable result; `--stream` emits NDJSON progress frames for CI/GUI consumers.
- **Fixed — proxied redirects now carry no-store cache headers (#B68).** Framework-emitted redirects on requests classified as reverse-proxied now include `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` (+ `Pragma` / `Expires`), so a browser never caches a proxy-context-derived redirect; the inter-bundle query 3xx forward path inherits the set. Direct production redirects are byte-identical, and the `301` default and route-declared `param.code` are untouched.
