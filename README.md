Node.js MVC framework with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) 2.5.1 — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — Node.js process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

## What's in 0.4.1

- **CLI Tier 2 — run-state + lifecycle commands.** `bundle:status` / `project:status` report a bundle's (or every bundle's) running/stopped state, PID, port, and active env — human-readable or `--format=json`. `minion:list` / `minion:kill` list and reap a project's running bundle child-processes (both pidfile-tracked and `ps`-discovered orphans) with a graceful SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation and a `--dry-run` preview. `bundle:copy` (alias `bundle:cp`) duplicates a bundle under a new name and `bundle:rename` renames one in place — both rewrite the bundle-name footprint and update the manifest / env / ports registry, with `--dry-run` / `--force`. `protocol:remove` reverts a bundle to the project's default protocol and scheme.
- **Runtime template override** — `self.setTemplate(file, ext)` lets a controller action choose its template at request time (e.g. a catch-all dispatcher), resolved verbatim under the templates root. Honoured by both the swig and nunjucks render paths.
- **Fixes** — nunjucks↔swig render parity (`self.setTemplate()` overrides, `controllers/setup.js` filter registration via `this.engine.addFilter()`, and a controller passing a partial `page` object no longer dropping framework-injected page data — webroot, view metadata, session); a crash that could kill a bundle serving static assets over HTTP/2 in dev mode under concurrent requests; `renderWithoutLayout` returning an empty body when the template referenced controller data as top-level variables; and clearer fail-fast errors when the `gina` CLI hits an uninstalled `GINA_VERSION` or when an interactive command (`bundle:add`/`bundle:remove`/`project:remove`/`protocol:set`/`port:set`/`view:add`) runs without a TTY.
