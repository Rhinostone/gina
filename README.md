MVC framework for Node.js and Bun with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).
- **Batteries included.** Forms & validation, sessions, uploads, async jobs, response caching, CSRF, security headers, route authorization, audit trail, i18n, OpenAPI + MCP generation — built in, not bolted on.

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| WebSockets | WS routes in `routing.json` (`"method": "ws"` + channel handlers, `:param` paths); WebSocket-over-HTTP/2 (RFC 8441) |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) — unified `.infer()`, token streaming via `.stream()`, inference-as-a-job via `self.inferAsync()` |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` or per-section `"ext": ".njk"` |
| Forms & validation | One rule engine for client and server — live checks, cross-field rules, ARIA states, localised messages; the server enforces the same rules on submit |
| DTOs | `gina.dto` schema builder — request validation with localised 422s (`param.dto`), response shaping (`param.responseDto`), JSON Schema export |
| Sessions | Hardened session plugin (SameSite / HttpOnly / Secure defaults) — Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Couchbase, and ScyllaDB stores |
| File uploads | Multipart via the maintained [`@rhinostone/busboy`](https://github.com/gina-io/busboy) fork — named upload groups with per-group extension allow-lists, size / count limits, and target dirs |
| Async jobs | `self.startJob()` background jobs — durable SQLite / MongoDB / Redis stores, retries with backoff, HMAC-signed completion webhooks, `/_gina/jobs/:id` status endpoint |
| Response caching | Per-route render cache — memory / fs / Redis tiers, cross-replica warm start, event-driven invalidation, RFC 9211 `Cache-Status` |
| Route authorization | `requireAuth` / `roles` / `policy` per route, login bounce with `resumeRequest()`, `self.hasRole()` |
| Audit trail | Opt-in append-only JSONL audit log (`self.audit()`), authorization denials auto-recorded, always-on request ids |
| CSRF protection | Signed double-submit token middleware + Origin/Referer pre-filter + hardened session cookie |
| Security headers | CSP with per-response nonces, HSTS, COOP / COEP / CORP, Referrer-Policy and the X-* family — per-header plugins or one `SecurityHeaders` wrapper |
| Secrets | `${secret:KEY}` placeholders in bundle config — fail-closed, env-backed; `secrets:scan` / `secrets:check` CLI |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels; structured JSON logs with request ids (`GINA_LOG_FORMAT=json`) |
| Dev Inspector | Embedded dev SPA at `/_gina/inspector` — request data, live logs, SQL with index-coverage badges, flow timings, app events, AI token stream |
| OpenAPI & MCP | `bundle:openapi` emits OpenAPI 3.1 from `routing.json`; `bundle:mcp` emits an MCP tool manifest; built-in MCP runtime server (stdio + Streamable HTTP) |
| TypeScript & ESM | Typed public surface (shipped `.d.ts`), `bundle:types` generates entity types from DTOs, dual CJS / ESM exports |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Container tooling | `image:build` synthesizes an OCI image (buildah), `image:run` / `container:ps` / `container:stop` (podman) — local or over SSH |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |
| Runtime | Node.js 22–26, or **Bun** (`bun add -g gina`) — install + boot validated end-to-end by a CI Bun smoke |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global   # or, on the Bun runtime: bun add -g gina
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

> **npm 12+** blocks install scripts by default, and gina's post-install bootstraps `~/.gina` and the framework dependencies. Install with `npm install -g gina@latest --allow-scripts=gina`, or allow it once for all global installs with `npm config set allow-scripts=gina --location=user`. (Not needed on npm ≤ 11.)

## What's in 0.5.21

- **Security — 500 bodies no longer carry stack traces outside local scope.** Uncaught controller and middleware errors route through the server-side error responder, which used to serialize the full stack — absolute server paths and frames — into the JSON `error` field, the inline HTML fallback, and custom-error-page data on every scope. Outside local scope the wire now carries only the error's message line (the JSON render delegate's HTTP/1.1 reason-phrase fallback and the cached-file stream error path included); the full stack goes to the server log. Local scope is unchanged — the development toolbar keeps its stack.
- **Changed — a missing bundle `routing.json` now fails the boot (deliberate).** A bundle whose `config/routing.json` was missing at boot used to start silently with only the framework-synthetic routes — every app route 404'd, and cross-bundle lookups threw hours later. The boot now refuses to start with an error naming the bundle and environment, exactly like a malformed `routing.json` always has; under an external supervisor (Kubernetes, a container restart policy, an init system) the restart retries until the release tree settles, while a bare `gina bundle:start` reports the crash once and stays down until restarted manually. The route-lookup not-found error also names the bundle and its rule count, so a degraded table is tellable from a mistyped rule — that half is browser-bundled, so rebuild your bundles.
- **Fixed — FormValidator: keyboard shortcuts on `autocomplete="off"` fields, the Safari-only gate, and stale error clearing.** The Safari-autocomplete keydown interception no longer swallows modifier chords (Cmd/Ctrl+A/C/V/X/Z run their native defaults instead of typing the chord letter into the field) and now runs on real Safari only — every Chromium UA carries the `Safari/537.36` token, so Chrome/Edge/Brave were wrongly intercepted. And when a live-check whole-form pass turns valid, every previously-errored field's message is now cleared along with re-enabling the submit trigger, instead of leaving a stale blocking error on screen. Browser-bundled — rebuild your bundles. (#B134/#B135/#B136)
- **Fixed — cross-bundle links in merged-process projects.** In a project whose bundles share one port (served by one process), the first cross-bundle `getUrl` permanently replaced the target bundle's routing table with the starting app's — every cross-bundle link to that bundle rendered a literal `404:[…]` marker instead of a URL. Each bundle now keeps its own routing table. Server-side only; projects with distinct per-bundle ports were never affected. (#B137)
- **Fixed — CSP `useNonce` on cache-enabled routes.** The framework-injected inline bootstrap's nonce was frozen at first compile inside the compiled-template and layout caches while the `Content-Security-Policy` header rotated per request, so every cache-path response failed nonce validation under an enforcing policy. The nonce is now injected per response, stale pre-fix layout-cache files heal in place, and cache hits re-mint both the stored header and body with a fresh nonce on both engines.
- **Fixed — the hardcoded `accept-language` response header is gone.** Accept-Language is a request header, but the framework env template declared it as a response default, so every response — error responses included — emitted it. An env.json that declares its own response headers keeps working verbatim; deployments whose generated env.json copied the old template line should remove it.
- **Added — popin eager preload.** Mark a trigger with `data-gina-dialog-preload="eager"` and the popin plugin fetches its AJAX content after window load, at browser idle — one trigger at a time, off the critical path — so a later open injects instantly with no second GET. Same safety gates as the hover/focus warm (the `"false"` opt-out, the disabled skip, cache dedup), and the pass is skipped under Save-Data. Default behavior is unchanged. Browser-bundled — rebuild your bundles.

## Governance

Gina is co-authored by **Martin Luther ETOUMAN NDAMBWE** ([Rhinostone](https://rhinostone.com)) and **Fabrice DELANEAU** ([fdelaneau.com](https://fdelaneau.com)). Final decisions on direction, API design, and releases rest with Martin Luther. Community contributions and RFCs are welcome and taken seriously. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for details.

## Supply-chain scanners

Gina is an MVC framework with a process-management CLI, so it uses Node's
`child_process` by design — to start and supervise application bundle processes
and the framework daemon, run local/SSH commands (`lib/shell`), launch the
inspector, and perform setup in the npm install scripts. Supply-chain scanners
therefore report a **Shell access** capability for `child_process`. This is
expected and intrinsic to a CLI framework, not a vulnerability: the install-time
commands are built only from local values (npm prefix, install path) and take no
network input.
