MVC framework for Node.js and Bun with built-in HTTP/2, multi-bundle architecture, and scope-based data isolation — no Express dependency.

- **HTTP/2 first.** Built-in `isaac` server with TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, and full CVE hardening (Rapid Reset, CONTINUATION flood, RST flood, HPACK bomb) — all on by default.
- **Multi-bundle.** One project hosts multiple independent bundles (API, web, admin, …). Each bundle has its own routing, controllers, models, and config. Share code via the project layer.
- **Scope isolation.** Run `local`, `beta`, and `production` from the same codebase. Scopes propagate through routing, config interpolation, and data (every DB record is stamped with `_scope`).
- **Batteries included.** Forms & validation, sessions, uploads, async jobs, response caching, CSRF, security headers, route authorization, audit trail, i18n, OpenAPI + MCP generation — built in, not bolted on.

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/2 server | Built-in `isaac` engine — TLS, h2c, ALPN, HTTP/1.1 fallback, 103 Early Hints, CVE-hardened |
| Multi-bundle | One project, N independent bundles with shared config and project layer |
| Scope isolation | `local` / `beta` / `production` — per-request and per-record |
| MVC routing | `routing.json` — declare routes in config, not code; O(m) radix trie lookup |
| Async/await | Controller actions can be `async`; rejections routed to `throwError` automatically |
| WebSockets | WS routes in `routing.json` (`"method": "ws"` + channel handlers, `:param` paths); WebSocket-over-HTTP/2 (RFC 8441) |
| ORM / entities | EventEmitter-based entity system; SQL files auto-wired to entity methods |
| Connectors | Couchbase, MongoDB, ScyllaDB / Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, AI (LLM) — loaded from project `node_modules` |
| AI connector | Any LLM provider via named protocol (`anthropic://`, `openai://`, `ollama://`, …) — unified `.infer()`, token streaming via `.stream()`, inference-as-a-job via `self.inferAsync()` |
| Template engine | [`@rhinostone/swig`](https://github.com/gina-io/swig) — maintained fork with CVE-2023-25345 patched; streaming SSE/chunked via `renderStream()`. Nunjucks supported as opt-in via `render.engine = "nunjucks"` or per-section `"ext": ".njk"` |
| Forms & validation | One rule engine for client and server — live checks, cross-field rules, ARIA states, localised messages; the server enforces the same rules on submit |
| DTOs | `gina.dto` schema builder — request validation with localised 422s (`param.dto`), response shaping (`param.responseDto`), JSON Schema export |
| Sessions | Hardened session plugin (SameSite / HttpOnly / Secure defaults) — Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Couchbase, and ScyllaDB stores; session-id rotation on login, opt-in absolute timeout, record destroyed on logout |
| File uploads | Multipart via the maintained [`@rhinostone/busboy`](https://github.com/gina-io/busboy) fork — named upload groups with per-group extension allow-lists, size / count limits, and target dirs |
| Object storage | `gina.storage()` — named drivers pairing an adapter (`local` filesystem, or `s3` for any S3-compatible provider with its SDK as a project-side dependency) with a key strategy behind opaque keys: `sharded` (dated), `cas` (content-addressed, deduplicating, refcounted, GC-swept) and `stream` (large media, resumable out-of-order segment uploads); size tiering, HTTP Range serving (`serveFromStorage()` — 206/416/304, strong key ETags), presigned-URL offload (307) on `s3`, embedded SQLite or Couchbase metadata store, `storage:stats` / `gc` / `verify` CLI |
| Async jobs | `self.startJob()` background jobs — durable SQLite / MongoDB / Redis stores, retries with backoff, HMAC-signed completion webhooks, `/_gina/jobs/:id` status endpoint |
| Response caching | Per-route render cache — memory / fs / Redis tiers, cross-replica warm start, event-driven invalidation, RFC 9211 `Cache-Status` |
| Authentication | `lib.authn` primitives — scrypt password hashing as self-describing PHC strings (argon2 / bcrypt verify-only for migration), NIST SP 800-63B policy, enumeration-safe `dummyVerify`, PCI-DSS account lockout, RFC 6238 TOTP |
| Route authorization | `requireAuth` / `roles` / `policy` per route or deny-by-default, login bounce with `resumeRequest()`, `self.hasRole()` |
| Audit trail | Opt-in append-only JSONL audit log (`self.audit()`), authorization denials auto-recorded, always-on request ids; opt-in HMAC hash chain verified offline by `gina audit:verify` |
| CSRF protection | Signed double-submit token middleware + Origin/Referer pre-filter + hardened session cookie |
| Security headers | CSP with per-response nonces, HSTS, COOP / COEP / CORP, Referrer-Policy and the X-* family — per-header plugins or one `SecurityHeaders` wrapper |
| Secrets | `${secret:KEY}` placeholders in bundle config — fail-closed, env-backed; `secrets:scan` / `secrets:check` CLI |
| Internationalisation | Per-bundle JSON catalogs, `t()` helper, swig + nunjucks `t` filter, CLDR plurals, ICU MessageFormat opt-in via `t.icu()` |
| Observability | Built-in `/_gina/metrics` Prometheus endpoint (opt-in, IP-allowlisted) — process metrics + HTTP counter / duration histogram with cardinality-safe route labels; structured JSON logs with request ids (`GINA_LOG_FORMAT=json`) |
| Dev Inspector | Embedded dev SPA at `/_gina/inspector` — request data, live logs, SQL with index-coverage badges, flow timings, app events, AI token stream |
| OpenAPI & MCP | `bundle:openapi` emits OpenAPI 3.1 from `routing.json`; `bundle:mcp` emits an MCP tool manifest; built-in MCP runtime server (stdio + Streamable HTTP) |
| TypeScript & ESM | Typed public surface (shipped `.d.ts`), `bundle:types` generates entity types from DTOs, dual CJS / ESM exports |
| Hot reload | WatcherService evicts `require.cache` only on file change — zero per-request overhead in dev |
| K8s ready | `gina-container`, `gina-init`, SIGTERM drain, JSON stdout logging |
| Container tooling | `image:build` synthesizes an OCI image (buildah), `image:run` / `container:ps` / `container:stop` (podman) — local or over SSH |
| Dependency injection | Mockable connectors and config for unit testing |
| Runtime | Node.js 22–26, or **Bun** (`bun add -g gina`) — install + boot validated end-to-end by a CI Bun smoke |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g gina@latest --prefix=~/.npm-global   # or, on the Bun runtime: bun add -g gina
gina project:add @myproject --path=$(pwd)/myproject
gina bundle:add api @myproject
gina bundle:start api @myproject
open https://localhost:3100
```

> **npm 12+** blocks install scripts by default, and gina's post-install bootstraps `~/.gina` and the framework dependencies. Install with `npm install -g gina@latest --allow-scripts=gina`, or allow it once for all global installs with `npm config set allow-scripts=gina --location=user`. (Not needed on npm ≤ 11.)

## What's in 0.6.10

> **Restart your bundles — no re-bake.** The browser bundle is byte-identical to
> `0.6.9` (verified), so `gina bundle:restart` is enough; this release is
> server-side only.

> **No settings reset.** `0.6.10` is a patch — the `shortVersion` stays `0.6`, so
> your `~/.gina/0.6/settings.json` is untouched. (`0.6.0` was the reset.)

**This release adds maintenance mode and closes a cross-site request forgery hole
in the admin endpoints.** It also makes boot-time bundle mounts safe when several
processes share one project tree — replicas over a POSIX network filesystem, or
containers bind-mounting a single checkout. **Two behaviour changes to check
before you upgrade** — a real directory sitting at a bundle's mount path is now
refused loudly instead of being silently deleted, and cross-origin writes to the
`/_gina/*` control endpoints are now refused. Both are covered in the
[migration guide](https://gina.io/docs/migration).

- **Added — maintenance mode.** A bundle can now be closed to the public without being stopped, via `settings.json > server.maintenance`. While a window is open every request except the framework's own `/_gina/*` endpoints is answered `503` with a `Retry-After` header and `Cache-Control: no-store`, carrying a self-contained page for a browser navigation and the standard JSON body for XHR, SPA-fragment and JSON callers. The gate runs on **both engines**, placed ahead of static assets, both output-cache serve points and routing — so unlike a route middleware, which only runs once a route has matched, it also covers static files and URLs that match no route at all. The liveness endpoint deliberately keeps answering `200`, so an orchestrator does not restart healthy instances over a declared window, and the toggle itself stays reachable so you are never stranded outside your own off switch. Chosen visitors can still browse: a shared bypass key works as a header, or once in the address bar — which then sets a short-lived cookie and redirects without the secret — under any deployment; the supplementary IP allowlist applies only to requests that did not arrive through a reverse proxy, since behind one every address is the proxy's. Maintenance can also be flipped at runtime through an admin-gated endpoint with an optional expiry; a runtime flip is not persisted, and a lapsed expiry reverts to your *configuration* rather than to "off", so a forgotten timer cannot re-open a site that configuration says is closed.
- **Security — cross-origin writes to admin `/_gina/*` endpoints are refused (#B384).** Present in every release up to and including `0.6.9`. These endpoints authorise callers by IP allowlist alone (`app.json` `admin.allowFrom`, loopback by default), and a browser attaches that ambient credential automatically — so an operator browsing from an allowlisted machine could be lured to a page that silently issued writes to `/_gina/storage/gc`, `/_gina/cache/clear`, `/_gina/release/rebuild` or `/_gina/maintenance`. The first three read their entire input from the query string and never read a body, so the attack needed no JavaScript and no CORS involvement at all: a plain auto-submitting form was enough. Such a write is now refused with `403` on both engines, using `Sec-Fetch-Site` where the browser sends it and comparing `Origin` against the connected authority otherwise — never against a forwarded header. **Two things are deliberately unaffected:** requests carrying no browser origin signal (`curl`, the gina CLI, deploy scripts) still work, so operator tooling is unchanged; and safe methods are untouched, so cross-origin `GET`/SSE channels keep working. No configuration change is required.
- **Fixed — boot-time bundle mounts are idempotent, atomic and concurrency-safe.** Every boot re-created every declared bundle's mount symlink in two non-atomic steps — unlink, then create — with no mutual exclusion anywhere in the framework, and the config loader did it for *every* declared bundle on *every* load. With a single process that is invisible. With several processes booting one shared project tree it is a race on the same directory entries: the mount name genuinely disappears between the two steps, so a boot could fail outright on a contended create, and because the configuration load is shared, one contended link could abort it for every bundle in the project. Mounting is now idempotent and atomic. A link that already resolves to its intended source is left completely alone — the steady-state boot writes nothing at all, which is what removes the contention rather than merely surviving it. A wrong or missing link is published atomically through a temporary sibling and a rename, so the name is never absent and two processes cannot collide. And a process that loses the race to another one publishing the *identical* link now treats that as success instead of refusing to boot. Genuine failures are still loud: a release whose source has vanished, or a real directory occupying the mount path, refuse by name. The same class of race is closed on the directory creation that accompanies a mount. **Contract note:** a real directory at a bundle's mount path used to be deleted and replaced with the link during config load, and now refuses the boot instead — if you hit that, remove or relocate the directory.
- **Docs — the guidance on addressing an out-of-request push is corrected.** `0.6.9` introduced `gina.pushToSession()` and warned against sourcing its recipient from the browser. That warning was written broadly enough to read as forbidding a **server-minted, integrity-protected token** that names the recipient — which is in fact the sanctioned shape, and the one the authenticated-hop pattern already relied on. The prohibition is now scoped to what it always meant: a *bare* recipient id in a client-writable field. The sanctioned shape is documented with the conditions that make it safe — verify the token and derive the recipient only from its verified claims, fail closed when it is absent or unverifiable, and keep it short-lived, since targeting integrity is not replay immunity.

## Governance

Gina is co-authored by **Martin Luther ETOUMAN NDAMBWE** ([Rhinostone](https://rhinostone.com)) and **Fabrice DELANEAU** ([fdelaneau.com](https://fdelaneau.com)). Final decisions on direction, API design, and releases rest with Martin Luther. Community contributions and RFCs are welcome and taken seriously. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for details.

## Supply-chain scanners

Gina is an MVC framework with a process-management CLI, so it uses Node's
`child_process` by design — to start and supervise application bundle processes
and the framework daemon, run local/SSH commands (`lib/shell`), launch the
inspector, and perform setup in the npm install scripts. Supply-chain scanners
therefore report a **Shell access** capability for `child_process`. This is
expected and intrinsic to a CLI framework, not a vulnerability: the install-time
commands are built only from local values (npm prefix, install path) and take no
network input.
